                    <h4>Best Cancer Treatment in India</h4>
                    <h6>Image Guided Radio-Therapy ( IGRT) in India</h6>
                    <p>Image Guided Radiation Therapy is a technique which involves the frequent use of diagnostic imaging to view the location, extent and size of the tumor during the course of the radiation therapy. This not only enhances accuracy and precision of the treatment, but also plays a critical role in the post therapy management of the patient.</p>

                    <p>Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) is one of the latest and cutting-edge innovations in radiation therapy and management of cancers. The therapy involves integration of treatment and imaging capabilities into a single machine, which makes it simpler and more effective in the management of cancers and tumors. This technology also increases the accuracy with which the tumor cells can be specifically targets, whilst reducing the damage on the surrounding tissues.</p>
                        <p>Radiation oncologists use image guided radiation therapy, or IGRT, to help better deliver the radiation to the cancer since tumors can move between treatments due to differences in organ filling or movements while breathing. IGRT involves conformal radiation treatment guided by imaging, such as CT, ultrasound or X-rays, taken in the treatment room just before the patient is given the radiation treatment on a daily basis.</p>
                        <h6>How does IMRT work?</h6>
                        <p>IMRT represents an evolution of radiation technology, from standard to 3D to IMRT. The evolution in technology offers the possibility of better cure rates with fewer side effects.</p>

                            <li>Standard radiation involved starting with plain x-rays of the pelvis. Lines were hand drawn on each x-ray film to make "radiation fields". Lead blocks were then created which matched the hand drawings. Usually, four radiation beams were used, entering the body from the front, back, and both sides.</li>
                            <li>3D-conformal radiation involved starting with a CT scan. The prostate, rectum, and bladder were circled on a computer screen which showed the CT images. Any number of radiation beams could be used, and the computer shaped the beams to precisely match the contour of the prostate. Beams could be angled so that they missed most of the bladder and rectum, but passed through the prostate.</li>
                            <li>IMRT is even more computer intensive than 3D. Every beam is broken down into tiny "beamlets", and each beamlet can be given a different dose. This results in beams with different intensities across their surfaces. Multiple beams are used for each treatment. Although the beams are all different in shape and intensity profiles, once they all converge on the prostate you are left with a high dose covering the prostate gland, and a lower dose hitting the normal tissues, such as rectum and bladder.</li>

                        <h4>Image Guided Radiation Therapy</h4>
                        <p>Image Guided Radiation Therapy is a technique which involves the frequent use of diagnostic imaging to view the location, extent and size of the tumor during the course of the radiation therapy. This not only enhances accuracy and precision of the treatment, but also plays a critical role in the post therapy management of the patient.</p>
                        <p>In the Image Guided Radiation Therapy, the machine that delivers the radiation dose (i.e. linear accelerator) is linked to any diagnostic imaging equipment like a Computed Tomography (CT scan) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET scan) or simply an X-ray, via a computer program, which facilitates the physician to view the tumor before, during and after the irradiation. This allows the radiation specialist to make necessary corrections and adjustments during the patient's exposure to the radiation doses.</p>

                        <h4>What are the benefits of Image Guided Radio-Therapy</h4>
                        <ul class="hsptList">
                            <li>Image Guided Radio-Therapy ( IGRT) treatment is beneficial in administering the radiation on the exact location of different types of tumours including that of lung, prostate, liver, pancreas, breast, brain, head and neck.</li>
                            <li>The radiation beam can be imaged and administered at the tumor center in the real time.</li>
                            <li>By controlling breathing, a lung cancer patient can reduce movement, there by, helping radiation to be more accurately targeted.</li>
                            <li>Least possibility of error as the correct amount of radiation dose can be administered to the exact location of the tumour.</li>
                            <li>Minimal side effects as the amount of radiation for significant/normal organs can be reduced.</li>
                            <li>More accurate treatment as real time imaging can be done.</li>
