                    <h4>Robotic Surgery for</h4>
                    <h6>Prostate Cancer, Kidney Tumor and Ureteric, Bladder Cancer in Indiar</h6>
                    <p>Robotic surgery is a type of minimally invasive surgery. “Minimally invasive” means that instead of operating on patients through large incisions, we use miniaturized surgical instruments that fit through a series of quarter-inch incisions. When performing surgery with the da Vinci Si—the world’s most advanced surgical robot—these miniaturized instruments are mounted on three separate robotic arms, allowing the surgeon maximum range of motion and precision. The da Vinci’s fourth arm contains a magnified high-definition 3-D camera that guides the surgeon during the procedure.</p>

                    <p>In prostate cancer treatment, millimeters matter. Nerve fibers and blood vessels are attached to the prostate gland. To spare these nerves, they must be delicately and precisely separated from the prostate before its removal. Surgeons use the precision, vision and control provided by da Vinci to assist them in removal of the cancerous prostate while preserving important nerves and blood vessels. In terms of cancer control da Vinci Prostatectomy has shown equal or lower rates of positive surgical margins i.e. meaning margins with cancer cells left behind. Other great concerns for prostate cancer patients: urinary continence and sexual function after treatment. Studies show patients who undergo a da Vinci Prostatectomy may experience a faster return of urinary continence following surgery and a lower rate of urinary pain than radiation (brachytherapy) patients. Several studies also show that patients who are potent prior to surgery have experienced a high level of recovery of sexual function (defined as an erection for intercourse) within a year following da Vinci Surgery.</p>

                        <h4>Benefits Of Robotic Surgery</h4>
                        <p>The da Vinci Camera: Standard laparoscopic surgery utilizes one single camera and limits the surgeon’s vision to 2-D view similar to watching a television. The da Vinci camera consists of TWO high resolutionfibreoptic cameras. They produce a true 3-D color picture to the surgeon sitting on the master console.</p>
                        <p>The da Vinci Surgical Instruments : Although they look a bit similar to standard laparoscopic instruments the robotic instruments have additional advantage of being articulated. This allows the instruments to open, close and fully turn and twist mimicking the movement of human wrist and fingers. This enables the robotic instruments to have 7 degree of freedom compared to only two degree of freedom in standard laparoscopic instruments.</p>
                        <p>Minimal Blood Loss with Robotic Surgery :The enhanced 3-D vision and advanced robotic instruments enable the surgeon to see even small blood vessels and control them even in areas which are not easily accessible with standard laparoscopy.</p>
