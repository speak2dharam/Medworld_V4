                    <h4>Novalis Tx Radiosurgery</h4>
                    <p>Novalis Tx Radiosurgery systems with state-of-the-art technology that integrates treatment planning in one system. Novalis radiosurgery accurately shapes the radiation beam to the area to be treated and uses imaging guidance and other methods to target the tissue or tumor to be treated while avoiding surrounding healthy tissues.</p>
                    <img src="/assets/img/novalis.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-3" alt="">
                    <p>A one of a kind technology that can treat both non-cancerous and cancerous conditions in a very less time is known as Novalis Tx radiosurgery system.The delivery of the beam is shaped in a precise way that is directed onto the tumor. The idea is to deliver the best possible treatment while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. Novalis Tx makes use of a procedure known as stereotactic radiosurgery for treating the patients. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a non-invasive process that delivers high doses of radiation on the tumor from different angles.</p>
                    <p>Novalis Tx is an ideal technology for treating those tumors that were previously located in inaccessible locations and were difficult to treat. This technology decreases the treatment time as the high-dose radiation beams matches the shape of the tumor that is being treated. The potential errors are also reduced as in the case of time consuming procedures. The entire treatment session can be completed in just 15 minutes.</p>
                    <p>Other radiosurgery systems use circular beams of radiation to treat tumors and lesions. Most tumors or lesions are irregular in shape so the circular dose cannot completely conform to their exact shape. Novalis Tx radiosurgery shapes the radiation beam precisely to a patient’s tumor or lesion, ensuring that the best possible treatment dose is delivered while healthy tissue is protected. The radiation beam also adapts to the patient’s breathing and other body movements to continuously maintain safe, complete and accurate treatment. Treatments are fast, lasting only minutes, and the patient wears a frameless custom-fit mask rather than an invasive head ring.</p>
                    

                    <h5 class="text-body-secondary">What types of conditions can be treated with Novalis Tx radiosurgery ?</h5>
                    <h6 class="text-body-secondary">Novalis Tx radiosurgery could be helpful in treating brain, spine, and other cancers. However, use of this treatment modality depends on the disease type and patient's medical condition. Tumors that could be treated using Novalis treatment are:</h6>

                    
                    <ul class="hsptList">
                        <li>Craniopharyngiomas</li>
                            <li>Gliomas</li>
                            <li>Skull base meningiomas</li>
                            <li>Brain tumors in children</li>
                            <li>Brain cancer that has recurred (come back) after treatment</li>
                            <li>Other types of cancer that have spread to the brain.</li>
                            <li>Lung, liver and prostate cancer</li>
                            <li>Spinal cancer</li>
                            <li>Pituitary gland tumors</li>
                            <li>Acoustic neuromas</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Novalis Tx radiation therapy can also treat seizures, Parkinson’s disease and other non-cancerous conditions.</p>
                    <h5>Benefits of Novalis Tx Radiosurgery</h5>
                    <p><strong>The highly advanced technique of Novalis Radiosurgery has been instrumental in helping people fight cancer while continuing their work, spending time with family and friends and taking part in their favorite activities. Novalis Tx is considered as a most advanced treatment for treating cancer that has helped a number of people around the world. Some of the benefits of the advanced treatment technique are: -</strong></p>
                    <h6>Non-Invasive</h6>
                    <p>One of the greatest advantages of frameless radiosurgery is that it provides a non-invasive and comfortable alternative to other radiosurgery systems. The immobilization is required by these radiosurgery systems that attaches the skull with a head ring.</p>
                    <h6>Precise radiation therapy</h6>
                    <p>Using advanced imaging and computer systems, the Novalis Tx radiosurgery system shapes the radiation beam around your tumor. Novalis Tx radiation therapy even adapts to breathing and other body movements.</p>

                    <h5>Benefits of shaped beam treatment include:</h5>
                    <ul class="hsptList">
                        <li>The best possible treatment dose for the entire tumor</li>
                        <li>Healthy tissue is protected</li>
                        <li>Radiation treatments are safe, complete and accurate With Novalis Tx, the shaped radiation beam moves around you, and the radiosurgery treatment bed is fully adjustable. Both the beam and your position can be adjusted so radiation only reaches the area needing treatment.</li>
                        <li>Novalis Tx can deliver a more powerful dose to treat tumors deep inside the body or brain</li>
                        <li>Some tumors previously considered untreatable can be helped with Novalis Tx.
Fast The treatment is delivered in as less as 15 – 20 minutes with the patient experiencing more comfort than the other radiosurgery treatment options. It ensures accurate delivery of treatment and reduces the possibility of body or tumor movement.</li>
