                    <p>Second opinions are a way to learn about your diagnosis and choices for treatment options. A patient has right and one of your most important right is the ability to get a second opinion about your diagnosis.</p>
                    <p>Many people feel uncomfortable with the idea that they are questioning the authority or expertise of their physician. Some fear that they will receive worse care if they appear to be pushy or difficult patients. Others worry that their actions will be seen as a "betrayal" and could sever any social ties they have with their doctor. Gathering multiple opinions on your medical condition can be one of the most emotionally fraught decisions that a patient has to make.</p>
                    <p>You might seek a second opinion to avoid a mistaken diagnosis, but the more likely scenario is that you seek multiple opinions to help you decide on a course of treatment with the best possible outcome and the best fit for your lifestyle and preferences.</p>

                        <p>Many people do not explore alternatives simply because they do not know how to go about it, or because they think it might be very expensive or inconvenient to consult another specialist whose clinic may be thousands of kilometres away. Imagine the financial implications, the hassle of travelling while you are sick, finding suitable accommodation and many other inconveniences.</p>

                        <p>As patients are expected to make more decisions about their care, they must have access to the best information about those decisions. Seeking out multiple sources of expert advice is one of the best ways to gather this information before proceeding with a treatment plan.

                            <h5>Second Opinions Save Lives</h5>
                            <p>You might be surprised to learn that medical errors are now considered to be the third leading cause of death.

                        <h5>Be In Charge of Your Medical Care</h5>

                        <h5>For The Peace of Mind</h5>
                        <p>Medical doctors have different personalities, different experiences and different training. Some physicians are more conservative and others are more aggressive. It might be a good idea to get a different perspective. Get a second opinion for your peace of mind!</p>

                        <h5>Increased Medical Complexity</h5>
                        <p>The medical and especially imaging industry knowledge base has dramatically expanded with the advent of such technologies as MRI, multidetector-row CT (MDCT), PET/CT, and many new treatment options and surgeries. Keeping up with the latest advances is becoming a challenge for all doctors. No one can be an expert in everything, so medical subspecialists have evolved.</p>

                        <h5>How a Second Opinion May Help?</h5>
                        <p>A second opinion may provide the following information:</p>
                        <ul class="hsptList">
                            <li>Confirmation of a diagnosis</li>
                            <li>Additional details about the type of disease</li>
                            <li>Perspective from experts in different disciplines</li>
                            <li>Other treatment options, in situations in which the doctor disagrees with the original diagnosis or the proposed treatment plan</li>
                            <li>Help you find out if there are less invasive and less expensive treatment options available.</li>
                            <li>A second opinion can also serve a general quality check – to make sure you’re really getting the most up to date, most effective treatment.</li>
                            <li>Helps you to save time and money by avoiding extra diagnosis.</li>
