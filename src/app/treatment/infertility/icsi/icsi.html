                        <h4>ICSI: Male Infertility Treatment in India</h4>
                        <p>ICSI is a process where a single sperm is injected directly into the egg using a fine glass needle. The main objective of ICSI is to ensure that the spermatozoa fertilize the egg membrane. The woman is stimulated with medications and then an egg retrieval procedure is performed so that several eggs can be obtained to attempt an ICSI procedure. ICSI is recommended in cases of severe male infertility, previous fertilization failures with IVF or situations in which there are a limited number of oocytes available.</p>
                        <h5>Steps in an ICSI treatment</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A very fine delicate needle is carefully inserted through the zona (the shell of the egg) and into the center (cytoplasm) of the egg.</li>
                            <li>The sperm is injected into the cytoplasm and the needle is removed.</li>
                            <li>The eggs are checked the next morning for evidence of normal fertilization.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Abnormal / Insufficient Sperm count / quality</h5>
                        <p>The most commonly encountered problems in men involve abnormal or insufficient sperm count. Problems can be either not enough sperm is being produced, or the sperm is of poor quality. The quality is usually determined by motility and shape. A normal sample will show 20 million sperm per millilitre at least half of which will be active. Depending upon the count / shape / motility different terminologies are used like oligospermia (low count), asthenospermia (poor motility), teratospermia . Further, various specialized sperm functional tests like sperm Hypo-osmotic swelling (HOS) test, DNA fragmentation Index (DFI), Reactive oxygen species (ROS) assessment, Nuclear chromatin decondensation test (NCD), Acrosome Intactness Index (AI), can be performed to predict the capacity of sperm to fertilize the oocyte (egg) but unfortunately there is not which can be done to treat the abnormalities in sperm. Some fertility drugs and antioxidants might improve count and volume. Majority of male infertility problems requires advanced assisted reproductive technique called Intra-Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI).</p>
