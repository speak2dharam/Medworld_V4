                        <h4>In Vitro Fertilisation ( IVF )</h4>
                        <p>In Vitro Fertilisation refers to the medical technique through which the female's egg cells are fertilised by male sperm outside of the body. Hormones are used to control the female’s ovulatory process in order to ensure the generation of a sufficient number of eggs. The procedure is completed with the removal of the eggs from the ovary of the female and allowing the union of the egg and the sperm in a controlled fluid. Once the egg is fertilised, it is transferred to the female uterus. IVF treatment is preceded by a range of screening tests for both the male and the female. Screening tests can be done in the patients' home country. The female should arrive in India a day or two prior to commencement of her monthly cycle and will be required to stay in India for two to three weeks. The male partner is required only for retrieval of the sperm, if he is otherwise normal from the fertility point of view.</p>
                        <h6>Infertility in Women</h6>
                        <p>Infertility in women is conventionally defined as failure to conceive despite regular sexual intercourse for a year, without using any contraceptive. There are many reasons for female infertility. Some of the most common reasons are as follows.</p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>Irregular or absent periods</li>
                            <li>Hormone imbalance</li>
                            <li>Smoking or alcohol use</li>
                            <li>Endometriosis</li>
                            <li>Fibroids</li>
                            <li>History of infertility</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h5>Treatment options for Women</h5>
                        <h6>Intra-Uterine Insemination (IUI) </h6>
                        <p>Intrauterine Insemination in India is considered as a possible treatment option in those cases where the male partner has low sperm count or low motility, or suffers from problems like premature ejaculation. It is also a good option where the female suffers from endometriosis. For this procedure to be successful, the fallopian tube (on at least one side) should be free of obstruction, along with a functional ovary on the same side.</p>
                        <p>During intrauterine insemination at IVF centres in India, infertility specialists would retrieve carefully selected and prepared sperm, and place these directly in the uterus. The sperm placement is done at the appropriate time after ultrasound tests confirm the presence of mature eggs. Fertility drugs may also be used to increase the chances of conception.</p>
                        <h6>In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF)</h6>
                        <p>In Vitro Fertilisation refers to the medical technique through which the female's egg cells are fertilised by male sperm outside of the body. Hormones are used to control the female’s ovulatory process in order to ensure the generation of a sufficient number of eggs. The procedure is completed with the removal of the eggs from the ovary of the female and allowing the union of the egg and the sperm in a controlled fluid. Once the egg is fertilised, it is transferred to the female uterus. IVF treatment is preceded by a range of screening tests for both the male and the female. Screening tests can be done in the patients' home country. The female should arrive in India a day or two prior to commencement of her monthly cycle and will be required to stay in India for two to three weeks. The male partner is required only for retrieval of the sperm, if he is otherwise normal from the fertility point of view.</p>

                        <h6>Infertility in Men</h6>
                        <p>More than 90% of male infertility cases are due to low sperm counts, poor sperm quality, or both. In 30% to 40% of cases of sperm abnormalities, the cause is unknown. It may be the end result of one or a combination of factors that include chronic illness, malnutrition, genetic defects, structural abnormalities, and environmental factors. Some of the common factors causing male infertility are:</p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>Prostate infections</li>
                            <li>Varicocele</li>
                            <li>A history of sexually transmitted disease</li>
                            <li>Low sperm or no sperm count</li>
                            <li>Poor sperm motility</li>
                            <li>Abnormally-shaped sperm</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Research studies indicate close to 10% of infertile men have immune reactions to sperm, which cause them to produce antibodies that kill sperm cells. Varicocele (enlarged veins in the testes) is another cause in men where the veins draining the testes get enlarged causing decreased oxygenation to the testes affecting sperm quality. Male tube blockage can also be due to obstructions in the tubes that transport fertile sperm. Sexually transmitted diseases are also linked to tube blockage problems. The fertilizing potential of sperm depends on the shape of spermatozoa, their motility and their ability to perform the functions necessary for fertilizing an egg and finally, the transfer of an intact genetic material (DNA) to the egg at the time of fertilization.</p>
