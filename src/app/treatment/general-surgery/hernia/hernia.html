                        <h6>What is Hernia ?</h6>
                        <p>A hernia is an opening or weakness in the muscular structure of the wall of the abdomen. This defect causes a bulging of the abdominal wall. This bulging is usually more noticeable when the abdominal muscles are tightened, thereby increasing the pressure in the abdomen. Any activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure can worsen a hernia; examples of such activities are lifting, coughing, or even straining to have a bowel movement. Imagine a barrel with a hole in its side and a balloon that is blown up inside the barrel. Part of the inflated balloon would bulge out through the hole. The balloon going through the hole is like the tissues of the abdomen bulging through a hernia.</p>
                        <p>A hernia is sometimes described as a rupture and is found commonly as a lump in the groin area. This type of hernia is referred to by doctors as a primary inguinal hernia. A hernia develops when a loop of the gut bulges out through a weakened part of the abdominal wall. Hernias can occur at any age and affect both men and women.</p>
