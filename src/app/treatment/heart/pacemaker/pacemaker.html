                        <h4>Pacemaker Implantation in India</h4>
                        <p>Heart rhythm disorder is a serious medical condition and could lead to problems ranging from simple palpitations to sudden death. But the modern Electrophysiology has provided great solution to the patients suffering from heart rhythm problems. The newer techniques and developments in Electrophysiology have enhanced the quality of life in these patients to a great extent. Heart hospitals in India have now the best electrophysiology teams to offer the best treatment for patients with heart rhythm disorders.</p>
                        <h5>What is a Pacemaker?</h5>
                        <p>A pacemaker is an electrical device that is used to regulate and normalise the rhythm at which the heart works. The rate at which the heart works and the rhythm at which it works are triggered by electrical impulses generated from within the heart. Abnormalities in these electrical impulses result in arrhythmia, where the heart rhythms are too slow, too fast or irregular.</p>
                        <p>A pacemaker has two components to it: the electric leads which are connected to the heart and a pulse generator/computer which detects abnormality in the heart's rhythm and delivers an electrical impulse to the heart to normalise the rhythm.</p>
                        <h5>Different types of Pacemakers</h5>
                        <h6>Permanent (internal) Heart Pacemaker</h6>
                        <p>This kind of Heart Pacemaker is implanted in a small pocket under your skin and is meant to be left in there for the rest of your life.</p>
                        <h6>Temporary (external) Heart Pacemaker</h6>
                        <p>This is used for initial stabilization of the patient during a cardiac crisis.</p>
                        <h6>Demand Heart Pacemaker</h6>
                        <p>This kind of Heart PacThis kind of Heart Pacemaker has an inbuilt sensing device which senses when the heart beat is too slow and turns the signal on. Once the heart beat is above a certain level, it automatically turns the signal off.</p>
                        <h6>Single Chamber Heart Pacemaker</h6>
                        <p>This kind of device has one lead to carry signals to and from one chamber of your heart, either the right atrium or, more commonly, the right ventricle.</p>
                        <h6>Dual Chamber Heart Pacemaker </h6>
                        <p>This kind of Heart Pacemaker has 2 leads and can monitor and deliver impulses to either or both of the heart chambers.</p>
                        <h6>Adaptive </h6>
                        <p>Rate Heart Pacemaker or Rate-responsive Heart Pacemaker - This kind of Heart Pacemaker automatically increases the pacing rate to meet the body's changing need.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h4>Medical conditions when a Pacemaker is Needed</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>BradycardiaAtrial fibrillation</li>
                            <li>Heart Block</li>
                            <li>Heart muscles problems</li>
                            <li>Aging or heart disease damages</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The pacemaker is implanted, normally in the upper chest, as part of a surgical procedure performed under local anaesthesia. The electrophysiologist / cardiologist assisted by fluoroscopy imaging, implants the leads at the designated locations within the heart, by threading them through veins leading to the heart. The other end of the leads is connected to the pulse generator unit which is implanted in the chest region. This procedure will take upwards of one hour and can sometimes take several hours.</p>
                        <p>Once the leads are attached to the heart as well as the pacemaker, the cardiologist would test the device to make sure that electrical impulses are flowing from the pacemaker to the heart and that the heart rate and rhythm are being read accurately by the pacemaker.</p>
