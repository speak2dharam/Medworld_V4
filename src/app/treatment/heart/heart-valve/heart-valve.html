                        <h4>Heart Valve Replacement</h4>
                        <p>When valve repair shall not be of help, replacing your damaged heart valve may be the most effective treatment for your condition. Also known as Heart Valve Replacement, Aortic Valve Replacement, is a cardiac surgery procedure in which the damaged heart valve is replaced with a new valve. This valve can be a tissue valve taken from some other body, or may be of animal or an artificial or prosthetic valve. Heart valve repair or replacement can be done for one single valve or more than one depending upon the condition of your valves.</p>
                        <h5>Types of Heart Valve Replacement</h5>
                        <h6>Open-heart valve replacement surgery</h6>
                        <p>It is a surgical procedure wherein the patient's heart is exposed in the operation theatre and surgery is performed on the internal structures of the heart. During the surgery, the patient is placed on a heart-lung machine that allows blood to flow through the heart while the surgery is being performed.</p>
                        <h6>Minimally Invasive Heart Surgery</h6>
                        <p>Minimally Invasive Heart Surgery, also known as Keyhole surgery, is performed by making small incisions of about 3 to 4 inches in the heart muscle, through specialized surgical instruments. In most cases, minimally invasive heart surgery focuses on Mitral valve repair, Aortic valve repair and Tricuspid valve repair.</p>
                        <p>Valvuloplasty </p>
                        <p>It is a technique wherein the stiff aortic valves are treated with the help of a balloon catheter. The balloon is positioned in the aortic valve and subsequently inflated to expand the size of the valve, leading to improved blood flow.</p>
                        <h4>Double and Triple Valve repair and replacement in India</h4>
                        <p>Double valve repair and replacement procedure aims at correcting or replacing both these damaged valves (aortic &amp; mitral together) with new functional valves. This is done through the open heart surgery. Triple valve replacement repair and replacement means repair or replacement of three valves of the heart.</p>
                        <h4>Benefits of Heart Valve Replacement Surgery <br>at World's Best Hospitals in India</h4>
                        <p>The most advanced technology for minimally invasive heart surgery is now available in India. Robotic da Vinci Surgical System combines superior 3D visualization along with greatly enhanced dexterity, precision and control in an intuitive, ergonomic interface with breakthrough surgical capabilities.In Robotic Cardiac Surgery, robotic assist the heart surgeon in performing surgery through tiny incisions. The surgeon has to sit in an operating room where he controls the instruments while looking at 3D images from the camera which is inside the patient. Various procedures can be performed in this case such as mitral valve replacement or repair, correction of HOCM etc. Use of Robotic Surgery in Cardiology has benefits as it involves less pain, scarring and risk that are otherwise involved. The surgeon can perform surgery through tiny openings in the chest, cracking the breastbone and spreading the ribs.</p>
