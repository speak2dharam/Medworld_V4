                        <h4>Robotic Heart Surgery</h4>
                        <p>Robotic Heart Surgery are now widely used to provide patients with less pain and faster recovery time. Limitations in surgical equipment have prohibited their use during heart bypass surgery -- until now.</p>
                        <p>The advancement of computerized robotic technology is one of the most exciting breakthroughs in surgery to date, enabling surgeons to perform complete, bypass surgery less invasively. Penn Cardiac Care at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania is proud to be the only hospital in Philadelphia and one of only 12 in the nation invited to participate in a study to determine the effectiveness of this revolutionary procedure.</p>
                        <p><strong>Robotic Heart Surgery in India is the latest and most advanced technique in the world to perform heart surgery with greatest precision Robot Assisted Heart Procedures are done to treat a variety of conditions:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>Mitral valve repair—surgery to repair problems with the valve between the upper and lower chambers on the left side of the heart</li>
                            <li>Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)—surgery that creates a path around blocked heart vessels so that blood can reach the heart muscle. The bypass is done using blood vessels from other parts of the body</li>
                        </ul>
                        <hr>
                        <h4>Da Vinci Robotic System</h4>
                        <p>Only da Vinci overcomes the limitations of both traditional open surgery and conventional minimally invasive surgery. The da Vinci System is a sophisticated robotic platform designed to expand the surgeon's capabilities - and for the first time - offer a minimally invasive option for major surgery.</p>
                        <p>With da Vinci, small incisions are used to introduce miniaturized wristed instruments and a high-definition 3D camera. Seated comfortably at the da Vinci console, your surgeon views a magnified, high-resolution 3D image of the surgical site. At the same time, state-of-the-art robotic and computer technologies scale, filter and seamlessly translate your surgeon's hand movements into precise micro-movements of the da Vinci instruments.</p>
                        <p>The System cannot be programmed, nor can it make decisions on its own. Rather, the da Vinci System requires that every surgical maneuver be performed with direct input from your surgeon.</p>
                        <p><strong>Heart Surgery procedures where Robotic Heart Surgery can be used</strong></p>
                        <p>Robot Assisted Mitral Valve Repair may be used to treat</p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>Blockages in the heart's arteries</li>
                            <li>Severe chest pain ( angina ) that has not improved with medicines</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Robot-assisted Atrial Septal defect repair may be used to treat a hole between the upper chambers of the heart that does not close properly during foetal development.</p>
                        <p>Robot-assisted Biventricular Pacemaker lead placement may be used to treat heart failure due to Atrial Fibrillation (irregular heart rhythm in the upper chambers of the heart)</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h4>What are the advantages of robotic heart surgery?</h4>
                        <p>The chief advantage of such surgery is that the incisions that are made are tiny, and therefore recovery from surgery is extremely quick. Rapid recovery from cardiac surgery is not only better for the patient, but it is less expensive for society.</p>
