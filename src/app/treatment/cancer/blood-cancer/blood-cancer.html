                        <h4>Leukemia (Blood Cancer) Treatment at World's Best Cancer Hospitals in India</h4>
                        <p>Leukemia(Blood Cancer ) is a cancer of the bone marrow and blood and is the most common type
                            of childhood cancer. The bone marrow is the soft, spongy center of the bones and produces
                            the three types of blood cells: white blood cells that fight infection, red blood cells that
                            carry oxygen and platelets that help with blood clotting and bleeding . Leukemia(Blood
                            Cancer ) begin in the bone marrow from where blood is produced. An uncontrolled growth of an
                            abnormal type of blood cell interrupts the development process of a normal blood cell. The
                            cancerous cells or abnormal blood cells prevent the blood from performing functions such as
                            preventing serious bleeding or fighting off with infections.</p>
                        <p><strong>Types of Blood Cancer</strong></p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li><strong>Myeloma :</strong> Plasma cells are targeted by this type of blood cancer.
                                Infection and disease fighting antibodies in the body are produced by plasma cells that
                                are basically white blood cells.</li>
                            <li><strong>Leukemia :</strong> This type of blood cancer is due to rapid production of
                                abnormal white blood cells. Leukemia can be found in bone marrow and in blood. These
                                abnormal cells are no more able to fight off infection and also impair the bone marrowâ€™s
                                ability to produce platelets and red blood cells.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lymphoma :</strong> Lymphatic system that produces immune cells and also removes
                                excess fluids from the body gets affected by lymphoma blood cancer. Lymphocytes are
                                considered as a type of white blood cell that helps in fighting off infection</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>Diagnosis of Leukemia (Blood Cancer)</h4>
                        <p><strong>A number of tests are performed for diagnosing blood cancer they include</strong></p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li><strong>Blood Test :</strong> The number of some specific blood cells is determined by
                                performing a blood test.</li>
                            <li><strong>Spinal Tap :</strong> Certain amount of clear fluid is taken that surrounds the
                                spinal cord and brain. This test is done for checking the presence of cancer cells.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chest X-ray :</strong> This x-ray helps in determining the presence of swollen
                                lymph nodes, bone damage or tumors growing in the bone marrow.</li>
                            <li><strong>Physical Exam :</strong> Swollen lymph nodes can be determined with the help of
                                this test. Growth of tumors in the bone marrow or damage to the bone can also be
                                determined with the help of a physical examination</li>
                            <li><strong>Biopsy :</strong> The presence of cancer cells is determined by taking a sample
                                of a bone marrow while performing a biopsy. This can be done through a bone needle
                                biopsy or bone marrow aspiration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cytogenetics :</strong> The change in the genetic material is determined by this
                                test.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>Leukemia(Blood Cancer) Treatment Options Available</h4>
                        <p>Leukemia is not a single disease. Instead, the term leukemia refers to a number of related
                            cancers that start in the blood-forming cells of the bone marrow. There are both acute and
                            chronic forms of leukemia, each with many subtypes that vary in their response to treatment.
                            In addition, children with leukemia have special needs that are best met by care in
                            pediatric cancer centers.</p>
                        <h6>In general, there are five major approaches to the treatment of leukemia:</h6>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>Chemotherapy to kill leukemia cells using strong anti-cancer drugs</li>
                            <li>Interferon therapy to slow the reproduction of leukemia cells and promote the immune
                                system's anti-leukemia activity</li>
                            <li>Radiation therapy to kill cancer cells by exposure to high-energy radiation</li>
                            <li>Stem cell transplantation (SCT) to enable treatment with high doses of chemotherapy and
                                radiation therapy</li>
                            <li>Surgery to remove an enlarged spleen or to install a venous access device (large plastic
                                tube) to give medications and withdraw blood samples.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h6>Stem cell transplantation</h6>
                        <p>Younger patients that are at high risk for dying from CLL might consider hematopoietic stem
                            cell transplantation (HSCT). Autologous stem cell transplantation, a lower-risk form of
                            treatment using the patient's own blood cells, is not curative. Myeloablative (bone marrow
                            killing) forms of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, a high-risk treatment using blood
                            cells from a healthy donor, may be curative for some patients, but most patients cannot
                            tolerate the treatment. An intermediate level, called reduced-intensity conditioning
                            allogeneic stem cell transplantation, may be better tolerated by older or frail patients.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Biological Therapy</h6>
                        <p>Biological therapy, also referred to as immunotherapy, involves the treatment with those
                            substances that affect the ability of an immune system to kill cancer cells. Monoclonal
                            antibodies and interferon are the two types of biological therapy. The purpose of monoclonal
                            antibodies is to stick to cancer cells in order to draw the attention of the immune system
                            to these cancer cells. On the other hand, interferon helps in stimulating the immune system
                            so as to destroy the cancer cells. These two options are generally used for chronic leukemia
                            instead of acute leukemia.</p>
                        <h6>Radiotherapy </h6>
                        <p>Radiotherapy, also known as radiation therapy, makes use of energy rays such as X-rays for
                            stopping the growth and multiplication of the cancer cells. This energy is directed at any
                            particular part of the body such as the spleen or also to the entire body.</p>
