                        <h4>Bone Cancer/Bone Tumor Treatment in India</h4>
                        <p>Bone cancer is considered as a rare cancer that develops in a bone. This cancer can start in any bone in the body and mostly long bones are affected that make up the legs and arms. Many bone tumors are benign that means they are non-cancerous and does not spread to any part of the body. Normal bone tissue is destroyed by this cancer and can spread to different body parts (known as metastasis). As a whole, bone cancer is categorized based on whether the cancer originated in the bone (primary) or whether it spread from another location to the bone (secondary). Secondary bone cancer, or cancer that has spread to the bone from another part of the body, is much more common than primary bone cancer.</p>
                        <p>Bone cancer symptoms may vary based on the type of bone cancer, but pain is the most commonly experienced symptom. Bone cancer most often occurs in the long bones of the body (arms and legs), so these are the most common sites for pain. Keep in mind that not all bone tumors are cancerous; some are benign. Bone pain is more often related to a benign condition, like an injury, than it is to cancer.</p>
                        <p><strong>Other symptoms of bone cancer include</strong></p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>Joint tenderness or inflammation</li>
                            <li>Fractures due to bone weakness</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Non-specific symptoms like fever, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, and anemia can also be symptoms of later stage bone cancer, but are also indicators of other less severe conditions.</p>

                        <h4>Diagnosis of Bone Cancer</h4>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>OPD Consultations</li>
                            <li>X-ray</li>
                            <li>Computerized tomography (CT) Bone scan</li>
                            <li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</li>
                            <li>Positron Emission Tomography (PET)</li>
                            <li><strong>Biopsy</strong> A sample of tissue (Biopsy) from the tumor is removed for laboratory testing. Testing is done to know whether the tissue is cancerous and, if so, what is the type of cancer. Testing may also reveal the cancer's grade, which helps oncologists to understand how aggressive the cancer is.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Types of biopsy procedures used to diagnose bone cancer include</strong></p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>Inserting a needle through skin and into a tumor. During a needle biopsy, surgical oncologist inserts a thin needle through the skin and guides it into the tumor. The needle is used to remove small pieces of tissue from the tumor.</li>
                            <li>Surgery to remove a tissue sample for testing. During a surgical biopsy, surgical oncologist makes an incision through the skin and removes either the entire tumor (excisional biopsy) or a portion of the tumor (incision biopsy).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Determining the type of biopsy patients need and the particulars of how it should be performed requires careful planning by the oncology team. Surgical Oncologists perform the biopsy in a way that will not interfere with future surgery to remove bone cancer.</p>
