                        <h4>Head and Neck Cancer Treatment at World's Best Cancer Hospitals in India</h4>
                        <p>Most head and neck cancers begin in the cells that line the mucosal surfaces in the head and neck area, e.g., mouth, nose, and throat. Mucosal surfaces are moist tissues lining hollow organs and cavities of the body open to the environment. Normal mucosal cells look like scales (squamous) under the microscope, so head and neck cancers are often referred to assquamous cell carcinomas. Some head and neck cancers begin in other types of cells. For example, cancers that begin in glandular cells are called adenocarcinomas.</p>
                        <h5>Types of Head and Neck Cancer</h5>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li><strong>Nasaopharyngeal Cancer :</strong> The nasopharynx is the airway passageway at the upper part of the nose at the back of the nose.</li>
                            <li><strong>Salivary Gland Cancer :</strong> Saliva produced by the salivary gland is the fluid that is released within the mouth in order to keep the mouth moist. Mouth helps in breaking down the food as it contains certain enzymes</li>
                            <li><strong>Hypopharyngeal and Laryngeal Cancer :</strong> A tube shaped organ located in the neck used for swallowing, breathing and talking is the larynx. The hypopharnx, also referred to as gullet, is the lower part of the throat surrounding the larynx.</li>
                            <li><strong>Oropharyngeal and Oral Cancer :</strong> Both tongue and the mouth is included in the oral cavity. The middle part of the throat is included in oropharynx.</li>
                            <li><strong>Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer :</strong> The air-filled areas surrounding the nasal cavity is known as the paranasal sinuses. The space at the back of the nose from where air passes on the way to the throat is known as the nasal cavity.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>Head and Neck Cancer Treatment Options at Best Cancer Hospitals in India</h4>
                        <p>Chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy are the three main types of treatment for administering head and neck cancer. Surgery or radiation therapy is considered as the primary treatments while chemotherapy is usually used as an adjuvant or additional treatment. Primary cancer can be easily treated with the help of radiation therapy. Radiation therapy can also effectively treat the neck. A neck dissection is also sometimes necessary for removing involved lymph nodes in the neck when the amount of disease in the neck nodes is very wide.</p>
                        <p>Surgery is considered as a very important treatment that can be done either before or after the radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is given afterward when it is necessary to remove the primary tumor surgically. The tumor is first tried to shrink by using radiotherapy and surgery is followed by radiotherapy.</p>
                        <h6>Following radiation therapy procedures are used for treating head and neck cancer</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT):</strong> The specific areas inside the tumor or malignant tumors are targeted by this high-precision radiotherapy that makes use of computer-controlled x-ray accelerators that delivers precise radiation doses. The high intensity radiation beam is focused on the tumor so as to damage it without disturbing any surrounding healthy cells.</li>
                            <li><strong>External Beam Therapy (EBT) :</strong> Through this therapy, a high-energy beam x-rays are delivered at the location of the tumor. The tumor site is the target of this beam and it can destroy cancer cells while sparing nearby healthy tissues. There is no placement of radioactive sources in the body of a patient.</li>
