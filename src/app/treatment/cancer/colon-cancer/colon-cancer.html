                        <p>Colon cancer, also known as bowel cancer or colorectal cancer or cancer of the bowel, is the cancer of large intestine (lower part of the digestive system). Majority of colon cancer cases start as small and non-cancerous clumps of the cells known as adenomatous. After a certain period of time, these polyps become colon cancers. These are the third most commonly diagnosed cancers in world. They start as a small proliferated, ulcerated lesions or thickenings from the inner most layers of bowel lining. Left untreated they grow in size, extend through the wall to adjacent organs, involve nearby lymph nodes and at latter stages involve the liver and other distant organs, through blood stream, manifesting as different stages of disease progression.</p>
                        <p><strong>COLORACTAL CANCER SYMPTOMS</strong></p>
                        <p><i>Many cases of colon cancer have no symptoms. The following symptoms, however, may indicate colon cancer</i></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pain and tenderness in lower abdomen</li>
                            <li>Passing of Blood in the stool</li>
                            <li>Constipation, Diarrhea or other changes in bowel habits like narrow stools.</li>
                            <li>Abrupt Weight loss</li>

                        <h4>Diagnosis of Colon Tumor</h4>
                        <p><strong>A number of tests are performed for diagnosing colon cancer that include</strong></p>
                        <h6>Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) Assay</h6>
                        <p>CEA levels in the blood are measured in this test. The normal as well as cancer cells release CEA in the bloodstream. When these CEA is found in large amounts then it indicates colon cancer.</p>
                        <h6>Proctoscopy</h6>
                        <p>A proctoscope (a thin and tube-like instrument having light and lens for viewing) is inserted into the rectum in this rectum test. Sometimes removal of the tissue is also done by using a tool in order to check the presence of a disease by examining under a microscope.</p>
                        <h6>Physical Examination and History</h6>
                        <p>This is done for examining the general signs of health and also for seeing any indications of disease that may include lumps.</p>
                        <h6>Colonoscopy</h6>
                        <p>This test is performed for viewing the colon and rectum from within in order to see the presence of cancer, polyps or abnormal areas.</p>
                        <h6>Digital Rectal Exam (DRE)</h6>
                        <p>This is considered as a test of the rectum. The insertion of the gloved and lubricated finger is done into the lower part of the rectum for viewing the presence of lumps. Vagina is examined in case of women.</p>
                        <h6>Biopsy</h6>
                        <p>The signs of cancer are checked by removing tissues or cells that are then examined under a microscope. The removal of tissue at the time of biopsy is helpful in checking the gene mutation in a patient that is responsible for causing HNPCC.</p>

                        <p>Certain other tests are also required for finding the cancer cells that have spread inside the rectum and colon or possibly to other body parts that include â€“ Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) Assay , Chest x-ray ,Positron Emission Tomography Scan (PET) ,CT scan ,Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) ,Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) .</p>

                        <h4>Treatment Option Available for Colon Cancer at World's Best Cancer Hospitals in India</h4>
                        <h6>Targeted Therapy</h6>
                        <p>Certain substances and drugs are used by the targeted therapy in order to target particular cancer cells without causing any harm to nearby normal cells. The two types of targeted therapy include </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Angiogenesis Inhibitors : This helps in stopping the growth of new blood vessels which tumors need to grow.</li>
                            <li>Monoclonal Antibodies : These antibodies are prepared in the laboratory with the help of a single type of immune system. Certain substances can be identified by these antibodies that are on the cancer cells or it also indentifies certain normal substances that are helping in the growth of cancer cells. These antibodies then attach themselves with the substances for destroying cancer cells and also prevent them from spreading.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Surgery </h6>
                        <p>Surgery is the mainstay of treatment and involves in block removal of diseased segment with adequate margins, surrounding tissue and lymph nodes. The names given to such resections are right hemicolectomy, transverse colectomy, left hemicolectomy, sigmoid colectomy, and subtotal colectomy</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Polypectomy : If the cancer is found in a polyp (a small piece of bulging tissue), the polyp is often removed during a colonoscopy.</li>
                            <li>Local excision : If the cancer is found on the inside surface of the rectum and has not spread into the wall of the rectum, the cancer and a small amount of surrounding healthy tissue is removed.</li>
                            <li>Resection : If the cancer has spread into the wall of the rectum, the section of the rectum with cancer and nearby healthy tissue is removed. Sometimes the tissue between the rectum and the abdominal wall is also removed. The lymph nodes near the rectum are removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.</li>
                            <li>Pelvic exenteration : If the cancer has spread to other organs near the rectum, the lower colon, rectum, and bladder are removed.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given before surgery to shrink the tumor, make it easier to remove the cancer, and lessen problems with bowel control after surgery. Treatment given before surgery is called neoadjuvant therapy. Even if all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation is removed, some patients may be given radiation therapy or chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.</p>
                        <h6>Chemotherapy </h6>
                        <p>Certain types of drugs are used for stopping the growth of cancer cells or for destroying the cancer cells. The injection of these drugs is done into a vein from where they enter the bloodstream and they then travel through the entire body.</p>
                        <h6>Radiation therapy</h6>
                        <p>High-energy beams are used for destroying cancer cells. Internal radiation and external radiation are the two types of radiation therapy. A radioactive substance that is sealed in catheters, needles wires or seeds is placed close to the cancer in the case of internal radiation. On the other hand, linear accelerators outside the body are used for sending radiation to the cancer in the case of external radiation. The type of radiation depends on the stage and type of the cancer.</p>
