                        <p>Liver cancer or Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the commonest cancers in the world which have a high incidence of Hepatitis B infection. Apart from Hepatitis B, it may be caused by other diseases that lead to cirrhosis of the liver such as Hepatitis C infection, and alcohol abuse.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, like many other cancers, liver cancer may go undetected until a late stage. It is often brought to attention by an ultrasound or CT scan done for pain in the upper abdomen or another unrelated symptom. Liver cancers are malignant tumors that grow on the surface or inside the liver. Typers of liver cancer are Hepatocellular Carcinoma , Cholangiocarcinoma , Hepatoblastoma and Angiosarcoma or Hemangiosarcoma</p>
                        <h6>The liver cancer symptoms are often indistinct Following are some indications of Liver cancer. The major symptoms are</h6>

                        <h4>Diagnosis of Liver Cancer</h4>
                        <p>Although there are no standard or routine screening tests for liver cancer, the following tests are being used or studied to screen for it.</p>
                        <h6>Physical examination</h6>
                        <p>Physical examination may show an enlarged, tender liver. Also, your skin and eyes may be checked for signs of jaundice.</p>
                        <h6>Blood Tests</h6>
                        <p>Physical examination may show an enlarged, tender liver. Also, your skin and eyes may be checked for signs of jaundice.</p>
                        <h6>Imaging Studies</h6>
                        <p>Imaging Studies like Abdominal CT scan and Abdominal Ultrasound test</p>

                        <h4>Liver Cancer Treatment Options Available at World's Best Hospitals in India</h4>
                        <p><i>The treatment options are dictated by the stage of Liver Cancer and the overall condition of the patient. The treatment to be given depends mainly on the size, number, and site of tumors in the liver. Before planning the appropriate treatment the functioning of the Liver is checked as also the spread of the cancer within and outside the liver is to be tested. The Various treatment options available are as follows</i></p>
                        <h6>Surgery </h6>
                        <p>Surgery is the removal of the tumor and surrounding tissue during an operation. It is likely to be the most successful disease-directed treatment, particularly for patients with small tumors (smaller than 5 cm). A surgical oncologist is a doctor who specializes in treating cancer using surgery.</p>
                        <h6>Hepatectomy </h6>
                        <p>When a portion of the liver is removed, the surgery is called a Hepatectomy. A Hepatectomy can be done only if the cancer is in one part of the liver, and the liver is working well. The remaining section of liver takes over the functions of the entire liver and may regrow to its normal size within a few weeks</p>
                        <h6>Liver Transplantation</h6>


                        <p>Liver transplant may be the best option for some people with small liver cancers. At this time, liver transplants are reserved for those with small tumors (either 1 tumor smaller than 5 cm across or 2 to 3 tumors no larger than 3 cm) that have not invaded nearby blood vessels. In most cases, transplant is used for tumors that cannot be totally removed, either because of the location of the tumors or because the liver is too diseased for the patient to withstand removing part of it.</p>
                        <h6>Chemoembolization</h6>
                        <p>This is a type of chemotherapy treatment in which drugs are injected into the hepatic artery and then the flow of blood through the artery is blocked for a short time so the chemotherapy stays in the tumor longer. Blocking the blood supply to the tumor also kills cancer cells</p>
                        <h6>Radiation Therapy</h6>
                        <p>Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy x-rays or other particles to kill cancer cells. A doctor who specializes in giving radiation therapy to treat cancer is called a radiation oncologist. A radiation therapy regimen (schedule) usually consists of a specific number of treatments given over a set period of time. External-beam radiation therapy is radiation given from a machine outside the body. External-beam radiation therapy is not often used for HCC.</p>

                        <h6>Targeted Therapy</h6>
                        <p>Targeted therapy is a treatment that targets the cancerâ€™s specific genes, proteins, or the tissue environment that contributes to cancer growth and survival. This type of treatment blocks the growth and spread of cancer cells while limiting damage to normal cells. Recent studies show that not all tumors have the same targets. To find the most effective treatment, your doctor may run tests to identify the genes, proteins, and other factors in your tumor.</p>
