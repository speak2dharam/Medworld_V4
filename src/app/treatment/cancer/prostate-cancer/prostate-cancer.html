                        <h4>Prostate Cancer</h4>
                        <p>Prostate cancer generally affects men over 50 and is rare in younger men. It’s the most common type of cancer in men. It differs from most other cancers in the body, in that small areas of cancer within the prostate are very common and may stay dormant (inactive) for many years. Most of these cancers grow very slowly and so, particularly in elderly men, are unlikely to cause any problems. In a small proportion of men, prostate cancer can grow more quickly and in some cases may spread to other parts of the body, particularly the bones.</p>
                        <p><strong>Symptoms are often similar to those of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Men observing the following signs and/or symptoms should see their physician for a thorough examination:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="hsptList">
                            <li>Blood in urine or semen</li>
                            <li>Inability to urinate</li>
                            <li>Nagging pain or stiffness in the back,hips,upper thighs or pelvis</li>
                            <li>Weak or interrupted urine flow,Painful ejaculation</li>
                            <li>Pain or burning during urination (Dysuria)</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>How Prostate cancer is Diagnosed?</h4>
                        <h6>Digital rectal exam (DRE)</h6>
                        <p>The doctor inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum and feels the prostate through the rectal wall for lumps or abnormal areas.</p>

                        <h6>Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Test</h6>
                        <p>A test that measures the level of PSA in the blood. PSA is a substance made by the prostate that may be found in an increased amount in the blood of men who have prostate cancer. PSA levels may also be high in men who have an infection or inflammation of the prostate or BPH (an enlarged, but noncancerous, prostate).</p>

                        <h6>Transrectal ultrasound</h6>
                        <p>A procedure in which a probe that is about the size of a finger is inserted into the rectum to check the prostate. The probe is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. Transrectal ultrasound may be used during a biopsy procedure.</p>

                        <h6>Biopsy</h6>
                        <p>The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist. The pathologist will examine the biopsy sample to check for cancer cells and determine the Gleason score. The Gleason score ranges from 2-10 and describes how likely it is that a tumor will spread. The lower the number, the less likely the tumor is to spread. There are 2 types of biopsy procedures used to diagnose prostate cancer</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Transrectal biopsy:</strong> The removal of tissue from the prostate by inserting a thin needle through the rectum and into the prostate. This procedure is usually done using transrectal ultrasound to help guide the needle.</li>
                            <li><strong>Transperineal biopsy:</strong> The removal of tissue from the prostate by inserting a thin needle through the skin between the scrotum and rectum and into the prostate.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If prostate cancer is diagnosed, the other tests( e.g Radionuclide bone scan, MRI. Pelvic lymphadenectomy, Seminal vesicle biopsy) are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the prostate or to other parts of the body.</p>

                        <h6>Minimally Invasive Laser Prostate Surgery for Prostate Cancer Green Light Laser PVP</h6>
                        <p>Green Light Laser Therapy is a minimally invasive treatment option that combines the effectiveness of the traditional surgical procedure known as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The GreenLight laser system delivers the ultimate BPH solution GreenLight is suitable for most patients with an enlarged prostate, the GreenLight procedure is creating a new standard of care — a standard that offers freedom from enlarged prostate / Prostate cancer symptoms .Most patients return home a few short hours after the GreenLight procedure and can return to normal, non-strenuous activities within days. The advantages of this approach over the traditional TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) are many: Rapid urine flow improvement,Quick return to normal activities ,Virtually bloodless procedure , Outpatient procedure in otherwise healthy patients.</p>

                        <h6>Surgical Treatment Options for Enlarged Prostate Cancer</h6>
                        <ul class="hsptList">
                            <li><strong>Radical prostatectomy :</strong> A radical prostatectomy is the total removal of the prostate and the surrounding tissues. It is done as a potential cure for prostate cancer. During the operation, the surgeon removes the prostate gland, seminal vesicles or area where the prostate meets the bladder (bladder neck). After the tissues have been completely removed, the surgeon reattaches the remaining part of the urethra to the bladder. A catheter is placed to allow for urine to pass from the bladder while the area heals. The catheter will remain in place for 1 to 3 weeks after surgery</li>
                            <li><strong>Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy :</strong> This is a minimally invasive procedure in which several small incisions are made in the abdomen. A laparoscope and other operating instruments are inserted through these incisions to remove the prostate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy :</strong> This newer procedure uses robotic equipment to assist the surgeon in removing the prostate. There is little difference in the outcome for open or laparoscopic surgical methods. The results depend on the skill and experience of the surgeon rather than the type of surgery.</li>
                            <li><strong>Radiotherapy :</strong> Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays or particles to destroy cancer cells. Radiation may be used for prostate cancer: as the primary treatment to destroy cancer cells , after surgery to destroy cancer cells left behind and to reduce the risk of the cancer recurring (adjuvant radiation therapy) , after surgery if the cancer comes back around the area where the prostate gland was (salvage radiation therapy) , to relieve pain or to control the symptoms of advanced prostate cancer (palliative radiation therapy)</li>
                            <li><strong>Chemotherapy :</strong> Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer drugs to treat cancer. It is usually a systemic therapythat circulates throughout the body and destroys cancer cells, including those that may have broken away from the primary tumour. Chemotherapy has an important role in the treatment of prostate cancer that has become resistant to hormonal therapy (hormone-refractory or castration-resistant prostate cancer).</li>
