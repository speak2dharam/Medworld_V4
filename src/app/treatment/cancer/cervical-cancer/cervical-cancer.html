                        <h4>Cervical Cancer Treatment at World's Best Cancer Hospitals in India</h4>
                        <p>Cervical cancer is the malignancy that starts in the cervix. Cervical cancer instigate from the cells located on the surface of the cervix. Cervical cancer occurs in several forms. The most common is squamous cell carcinoma, which accounts for 85 to 90 percent of cervical cancers. Other forms include adenocarcinomas and combination cancers such as adenosquamous carcinoma. Some strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV), a virus transmitted during sex, play a role in causing most cases of cervical cancer. The type of cervical cancer is determined by the type of cell where the early genetic mutation occurred. The type also helps in determining the specific treatment for a patient. There are two main types of cervical cancer that include â€“</p>
                        <ul class="hsptList">
                            <li><strong>Adenocarcinomas:</strong> This type takes place in the glandular cells lining the cervical canal. Adenocarcinomas accounts for a smaller portion of all cervical cancers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Squamous Cell Carcinomas:</strong> This type starts in the flat and thin cells lining the bottom of the cervix. Squamous cell carcinomas make up for a large majority of cervical cancers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Abnormal cervical cell changes rarely cause symptoms. But you may have symptoms if those cell changes grow into cervical cancer. Symptoms of cervical cancer may include:</p>
                        <ul class="hsptList">
                            <li>Bleeding from the vagina that is not normal or a change in your menstrual cycle.</li>
                            <li>Bleeding when something comes in contact with your cervix, such as during sex</li>
                            <li>Pain during sex</li>
                            <li>Vaginal discharge that is tinged with blood</li>
                            <li>Leakage of urine or feces from vagina</li>
                            <li>Swelling in legs.</li>
                            <li>Loss of weight.</li>

                        <h4>Diagnosis of Cervical Cancer</h4>
                        <p>The role of the Pap smear is to screen for cervical cancers and cervical pre-cancers. In its early stages, cervical cancer usually has no symptoms.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pap smear :</strong> In this test, Gyneconcologist collects cells from the cervix during a vaginal exam to look for abnormal, or precancerous, changes in the lining of the cervix</p>
                        <p><strong>Colposcopy :</strong> If the Pap smear results are abnormal, Gyneconcologist may check the cervix using a magnifying lens (colposcopy) and collects and examines cells (biopsy) to determine whether cancer is present.</p>
                        <p><i>Some other tests are also ordered when cervical cancer is diagnosed. The spread of the cancer can be easily determined with the help of these tests. The different tests include </i></p>
                        <ul class="hsptList">
                            <li>MRI of the pelvis</li>
                            <li>Chest x-ray</li>
                            <li>Intravenous pyelogram (IVP)</li>
                            <li>CT scan of the pelvis</li>
                            <li>MRI of the pelvis</li>

                        <h4>Cervical Cancer Treatment Options in India</h4>
                        <p><strong>Removal or destruction of cancerous cells is done through surgery. Different types of surgeries done for early cervical cancer are</strong></p>
                        <ul class="hsptList">
                            <li><strong>Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP):</strong> In this electricity is used to eliminate abnormal tissues.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cryotherapy:</strong> The abnormal cells are made to freeze in this therapy</li>
                            <li><strong>Laser therapy:</strong> Malignant cells are burnt with the help of light.</li>
                            <li><strong>Radical hysterectomy:</strong> It includes removal of the uterus and other surrounding tissues including lymph nodes and upper part of the vagina.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chemotherapy :</strong> Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer drugs given intravenously or by mouth to destroy cancerous cells. Doctors prescribe higher doses of chemotherapy when the cancer has spread beyond the tumor or if the cancer returns after initial treatment. Studies show that low-dose chemotherapy, when combined with radiation therapy, improves survival rates in women who have advanced cervical cancer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Radiation therapy :</strong> High-powered energy is used in this therapy for destroying cancer cells. Radiation therapy when given internally is performed by placing devices filled with radioactive material around the cervix. External beam radiation is given when radiation therapy is performed externally. These methods can also be combined together. Chemotherapy is also sometimes combined with radiation therapy for destroying or shrinking a tumor that is still remaining after surgery. Menstruating may stop in premenopausal women due to radiation therapy and may start menopause.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reconstructive surgery :</strong> Gyneconcologist and a plastic surgeon work together to restore as much anatomy and function as possible through reconstructive surgery. This teamwork is especially important in radical cancer surgery that includes surgical reconstruction as part of the treatment plan.</li>
