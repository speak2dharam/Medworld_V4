                        <h4>Oral Cancer Treatment at World's Best Cancer Hospitals in India</h4>
                        <p>Oral cancer is part of a group of cancers called head and neck cancers. Oral cancer can develop in any part of the oral cavity or oropharynx. Most oral cancers begin in the tongue and in the floor of the mouth. Almost all oral cancers begin in the flat cells (squamous cells) that cover the surfaces of the mouth, tongue, and lips. These cancers are called squamous cell carcinomas. When oral cancer spreads (metastasizes), it usually travels through the lymphatic system. Cancer cells that enter the lymphatic system are carried along by lymph, a clear, watery fluid. The cancer cells often appear first in nearby lymph nodes in the neck.</p>
                        <p>Cancer cells can also spread to other parts of the neck, the lungs, and other parts of the body. When this happens, the new tumor has the same kind of abnormal cells as the primary tumor. For example, if oral cancer spreads to the lungs, the cancer cells in the lungs are actually oral cancer cells. The disease is metastatic oral cancer, not lung cancer. It is treated as oral cancer, not lung cancer.Oral cancer happens when there is something wrong or unusual in the normal cell lifecycle. This abnormal working of the cell lifecycle results in uncontrollable growth and reproduction of these cells.</p>

                            <li>Removal of the tumor or a larger area to remove the tumor and surrounding healthy tissue</li>
                            <li>Removal of part or all of the jaw</li>
                            <li>Maxillectomy (removal of bone in the roof of the mouth)</li>
                            <li>Removal of lymph nodes and other tissue in the neck</li>
                            <li>Plastic surgery, including skin grafts, tissue flaps or dental implants to restore tissues removed from the mouth or neck</li>

                            <li><strong>Biological Therapy:</strong> The activity of the cancer cells is changed with the help of biological therapy. A type of biological therapy is known as Cetuximab that is also referred to as a monoclonal antibody. The surface of the cancer cells that triggers the development of cancer cells is blocked with the help of Cetuximab.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> This therapy makes use of drugs for destroying the cancer cells. The injection of these drugs is done into a vein. Chemotherapy can also be combined with radiation therapy. Chemotherapy destroys the cancer cell that may have traveled somewhere else in the body while radiotherapy destroys the cancer area.</li>
                            <li><strong>Radiotherapy:</strong> This therapy makes use of radiation for destroying cancer cells. This therapy shrinks the tumor by targeting a beam of radiation onto the cancer cells. Rarely, a radioactivity source can be implanted in the mouth that is known as Brachytherapy. The nearby tissues are not damaged by this therapy.</li>
