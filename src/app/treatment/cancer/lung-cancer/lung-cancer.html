                        <h4>World's Advanced Lung Cancer Treatment in India</h4>
                        <h6>What is Lung Cancer?</h6>
                        <p>A Lung Cancer is when out-of-control cell growth occurs in one or both lungs. The cancer can arise in any part of the lung, but majority of it arises in the epithelial cells, which are the lining of the Bronchi and bronchioles i.e. the larger and the smaller airways of the lungs. Lung cancer is predominantly a disease of the elderly almost 70% of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 65 years of age.</p>
                        <p>Lung Cancer is largely classified into two main types based on the cancer's appearance under a microscope viz. Small Cell Carcinoma which accounts for only 20% of the total lung cancers and Non small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) which accounts for 80% of lung cancers.</p>

                        <h4>Diagnosis of Lung Cancer</h4>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>History and physical examination, and imaging with chest X-ray and CT scan or MRI.</li>
                            <li>Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is a specialized imaging technique that uses short-lived radioactive drugs to produce three-dimensional colored images of those substances in the tissues within the body, in a growing tumor.</li>
                            <li>Bone scans are used to create images of bones on a computer screen or on film.</li>
                            <li>Sputum cytology: The diagnosis of lung cancer requires confirmation of malignant cells by a pathologist. The simplest method to establish the diagnosis is the examination of sputum under a microscope.</li>
                            <li>Bronchoscopy: Examination of the airways through a probe inserted through the nose or mouth may reveal areas of tumor that can be sampled (biopsied) for diagnosis by a pathologist.</li>
                            <li>Needle biopsy: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) through the skin, most commonly performed with radiological imaging for guidance, may be useful in retrieving cells for diagnosis from tumor nodules in the lungs.</li>
                            <li>Thoracentesis: Sometimes lung cancers lead to an accumulation of fluid in the space between the lungs and chest wall (called a pleural effusion). Aspiration of a sample of this fluid with a thin needle (thoracentesis) may reveal the cancer cells and establish diagnosis.</li>
                            <li>Bone Scan- to check if the cancer has spread to the bones.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Lung Cancer Treatment Options Available at Best Hospital in India</h4>
                        <p>The treatments for lung cancer depend on the stage of the cancer, personal characteristics, health status, type of the cancer and age. A number of therapies are provided to a patient as there is no single treatment available for lung cancer. Radiation, surgery and chemotherapy are considered as the major lung cancer treatment.</p>
                        <h6>Surgery</h6>
                        <p>One of the oldest methods for treating lung cancer is surgery. The surgical removal of the tumor and surrounding lymph nodes is done if there is I or II stage cancer that has not metastasized. Palliative or curative are the two types of lung cancer surgeries. Palliative surgery may not remove cancer but can remove an open airway or obstruction that was making the patient uncomfortable. Curative surgery removes all types of cancerous tissue in those patients who are in early stage lung cancer.</p>
                        <h6>Chemoembolization </h6>
                        <p>Strong chemicals are used in chemotherapy that interferes with cell division process and damages DNA or proteins. The aim of these treatments is to rapidly divide the cells. The normal cells can be recovered from any chemical-induced damage whereas cancer cells cannot be recovered. The medicines in chemotherapy travel in a systematic way by passing from the complete body and destroying the original tumor cells that have spread in the whole body. Usually many therapies are combined that also includes many types of chemotherapy.</p>

                        <h6>Radiation Therapy</h6>
                        <p>Radiation therapy may be employed as a treatment for both NSCLC and SCLC. Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays or other types of radiation to kill dividing cancer cells. Radiation therapy may be given as curative therapy, palliative therapy (using lower doses of radiation than with curative therapy), or as adjuvant therapy in combination with surgery or chemotherapy. Radiation therapy generally only shrinks a tumor or limits its growth when given as a sole therapy, yet in 10%-15% of people it leads to long-term remission and palliation of the cancer. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy can further prolong survival when chemotherapy is administered. External radiation therapy can generally be carried out on an outpatient basis, while internal radiation therapy requires a brief hospitalization.</p>

                        <h6>Targeted Therapy</h6>
                        <p>Targeted therapy drugs more specifically target cancer cells, resulting in less damage to normal cells than general chemotherapeutic agents. Erlotinib and gefitinib target a protein called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is important in promoting the division of cells. This protein is found at abnormally high levels on the surface of some types of cancer cells, including many cases of non-small cell lung cancer.</p>
