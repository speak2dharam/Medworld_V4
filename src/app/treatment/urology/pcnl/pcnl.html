                        <p>Urology is a medical and surgical specialty that deals with urinary tracts of males and females, and on the reproductive system of males. Indian hospitals have some of the finest urologists who have valuable expertise to diagnose, treat, and manage patients with urological disorders. The organs covered by urology include the kidneys, adrenal glands, ureters, urinary bladder, urethra, and the male reproductive organs (testes, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles and prostate). Combining the latest World's Best technologies with the healing touch of experienced hands, Indian Hospitals bring the best -in-class patient care within your reach. Painless procedures, assured relief and a success rate that compares favourably with the best such facilites in the World.</p>

                        <h4>Minimally Invasive Surgeries for (PCNL) Kidney stone Percutaneous nephrolithotomy</h4>
                        <p>Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a procedure to remove medium-sized or large stones from the kidney by means of a nephroscope passed into the kidney through a small puncture created in the patient's back. A nephroscope uses an ultrasonic or laser probe to break up large kidney stones and suction it out. This procedure is usually done under general anaesthesia or spinal anaesthesia.</p>
                        <p>To undergo PCNL, it is ideal for the patient to have two functioning kidneys and large sized (2 cm) stone in one of the kidneys with extrarenal pelvis with mild to moderate hydronephrosis.</p>
                        <p>The advantage of the PCNL procedure as against an open surgery is that PCNL reduces the length of hospital stay, and leaves only a small stab wound scar. Also during the post-operative period, a negligible amount of pain is felt allowing the patient to recover faster.</p>
                        <p>The surgical application of robotic systems is one of the most exciting and significant technological developments of this century; its future implications are incalculable.Huge strides have been made in the field of closed operations in the past 10 years and the use of robotic systems has emerged as the principle solution to technical limitations</p>
                        <h6>How is the Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL ) Surgery performed?</h6>
                        <p>While you are under the general anaesthetic the surgeon will examine your bladder with a long, thin, semi-rigid or flexible telescope and pass a small tube up to your kidney, which has the stone. This is used to pass a mixture of a coloured dye and x-ray dye to the kidney making it easier to see during the operation.</p>
                        <p>You will then be placed face down on the operating table and the consultant will make one or more small incisions into your back. This is done using special metal or balloon dilators (see diagram). This enables the consultant to pass a telescope into your kidney.</p>
                        <p>The stone or stones in the kidney are then removed either intact or in pieces after breaking them with special instruments. X-rays will be taken during and at the end of the procedure to ensure that all accessible bits of the stone have been removed from your kidney.</p>
                        <p>A telescope is passed down into the kidney so that the surgeon can see the stone.</p>
                        <p>The stone is broken up and then the pieces are removed using a special instrument.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h4>Why is Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) Necessary?</h4>
                        <p>You have been diagnosed as having a kidney stone (or stones) causing some, or all, of these symptoms: pain, infections, bleeding or obstruction of your kidney, which if left untreated, may lead to further symptoms or complications, such as severe infection or loss of kidney function. This operation (PCNL) is performed to remove large kidney stones using a keyhole approach. This is a major operation despite the term ‘keyhole surgery’. The procedure requires a general anaesthetic and may last 1 to 3 hours with a hospital stay from 4 to 7 days. The success rate of kidney stone clearance ranges from 75% to 100% depending on various factors.</p>

                        <h4>What are the Advantages Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL)Surgery</h4>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>Mini – invasive operation, less pain, short hospital stay (3 or 4 days), quick recovery and early return to work (7 to 10 days)</li>
                            <li>Avoid a surgical scar, meaning that avoids the complications of a large incision to remove the kidney stone</li>
                            <li>Limit residual stone. This is the special advantage of PCNL over other intervention due to its possibility to look inside the ureter and renal calyx to check which may not always be done by open operation and ESWL procedure.</li>
                            <li>Minimize the occurrence of postoperative infections (compared with open surgery).</li>
                            <li>Less harm to the kidney function (the influence of PCNL on kidney function is smaller than 1% while open surgery may cause the loss of 30% kidney function due to the incision made on renal parenchyma).</li>
