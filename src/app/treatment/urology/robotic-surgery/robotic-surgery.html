                        <p>Urology is a medical and surgical specialty that deals with urinary tracts of males and females, and on the reproductive system of males. Indian hospitals have some of the finest urologists who have valuable expertise to diagnose, treat, and manage patients with urological disorders. The organs covered by urology include the kidneys, adrenal glands, ureters, urinary bladder, urethra, and the male reproductive organs (testes, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles and prostate). Combining the latest World's Best technologies with the healing touch of experienced hands, Indian Hospitals bring the best -in-class patient care within your reach. Painless procedures, assured relief and a success rate that compares favourably with the best such facilites in the World.</p>

                        <h4>Most Advanced Robotic Surgery for Prostate Cancer in India</h4>
                        <p>Robotic surgery involves use of the da Vinci robotic surgical unit in performing complex surgical procedures such as prostatectomy (removal of the prostate gland for cancer). Originally developed for space and military uses, this advanced technology allows the operating surgeon to sit behind a console and control the robot that is next to the patient to perform surgery.</p>
                        <p>This technology allows the surgeon to operate with very small and precise instruments under a 3 dimensional (3-D) vision, which is magnified up to 10 times. This is achieved by inserting the camera and the instruments into the patient’s body through small cuts (incisions) ranging from 5 – 12 mm in size.</p>
                        <h6>Da Vinci Master Slave Robotic System</h6>
                        <p>The surgical application of robotic systems is one of the most exciting and significant technological developments of this century; its future implications are incalculable.Huge strides have been made in the field of closed operations in the past 10 years and the use of robotic systems has emerged as the principle solution to technical limitations</p>
                        <p>The use of robotic surgical systems has numerous advantages. Whereas modern laparoscopic systems give only a two-dimensional vision, robotic systems give the surgeon a three-dimensional field of vision and depth, provide arms that, unlike the human hand, never tire and permit an unprecedented continuityin operations. Since robotic systemsexceed even the human hand’s freedom and facility of movement, far greater delicacy and dexterity is achieved. Modern robotic systems fall into three categories; active, semi-active and master-slave.But the most commonly used are master-slave systems distinguished by the surgeon’s absolute control of the robot via a remote control console.</p>
                        <p>The Da Vinci is a sophisticated master-slave robot that incorporates 3-D high definition visualization, scaling of movement, and wristed instrumentation. The operations with the Da Vinci System are performed with no direct mechanical connection between the surgeon and the patient. The surgeon is working a few feet away from the operating table, while seated at a computer console with a three-dimensional view of the operating field.</p>
                        <p>Robotic Prostatectomy, also known as Robotic surgery for prostate cancer or da Vinci Prostatectomy is a minimally invasive surgery that is now the preferred approach for removal of the prostate in those diagnosed with organ-confined prostate cancer. The da Vinci Prostatectomy may be the most effective, least invasive prostate surgery performed today. Though any diagnosis of cancer can be traumatic, the good news is that if your doctor recommends prostate surgery, the cancer was probably caught early. And, with da Vinci Prostatectomy, the likelihood of a complete recovery from prostate cancer without long-term side effects is, for most patients, better than it has ever been.</p>
                        <p>The operation is performed using the daVinci Surgical system and 3-D endoscopic and wristed instruments inserted through 5-6 small incisions across the mid-abdomen</p>
