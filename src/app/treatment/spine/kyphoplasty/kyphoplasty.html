                        <h4>Disc Kyphoplasty</h4>
                        <p>If you have been diagnosed with a spinal fracture caused by osteoporosis, cancer or benign tumors, balloon kyphoplasty is a treatment option you may want to consider. Balloon kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive procedure that can significantly reduce back pain and repair the broken bone of a spinal fracture. The procedure is called balloon kyphoplasty because orthopaedic balloons are used to lift the fractured bone and return it to the correct position. Before the procedure, you will have a medical exam and undergo diagnostic studies such as X-rays, to determine the precise location of the fracture. Balloon kyphoplasty can be done under local or general anesthesiaâ€”your physician will decide which option is appropriate for you. Balloon kyphoplasty takes about one hour per fracture treated. It can be done on an inpatient or outpatient basis, depending on medical necessity. After the procedure, you will likely be transferred to the Recovery Room for about an hour for observation. The aim of Kyphoplasty is to reduce the pain of fractured vertebra, to reinforce the weakened bone and to restore normal vertebral height.</p>
                        <h5>When is Kyphoplasty recommended ?</h5>
                        <p>Kyphoplasty is done on patients who experience painful symptoms or spinal deformities due to vertebral compression fractures resulting from osteoporosis. Kyphoplasty is also performed on patients who</p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>Are aged or are in poor health to tolerate open spinal surgery.</li>
                            <li>Have too frail bones for surgical spinal repair</li>
                            <li>Have a vertebral damage due to a cancerous tumor</li>
                            <li>Are younger and have osteoporosis caused by a long-term steroid management or a metabolic disorder</li>

                        <h4>Benefits of Kyphoplasty</h4>
                        <p>Limitations in the traditional treatments of vertebral compression fractures have led to the refinement of such procedures as kyphoplasty. This procedure provide new options for compression fractures and are designed to relieve pain, reduce and stabilize fractures, reduce spinal deformity, and stop the "downward spiral" of untreated osteoporosis.</p>
