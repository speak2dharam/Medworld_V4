                        <p>Our network hospitals have the most advanced spine surgery facilities. The spine surgeons here use minimally invasive and computer guided techniques in spine surgery. In a Minimally Invasive spine surgery the surgeon makes a few small incisions unlike the open surgery where a single large incision is made. Minimally Invasive spine surgery has several important benefits for the patients. If you have been advised spine surgery your first choice should be the latest minimally invasive technique developed by our world's best hospitals in India. Most advanced Technology like Intra Operative MRI, Brain Suite and Computer Assisted Navigation System are deployed by highly trained surgeons for accurate and safe Spine Surgeries through a small incision.</p>
                        <p>Why should you choose to get Indian hospitals offer the best spinal surgery treatment in India at affordable prices. MedWorld india associated best spine surgery hospitals in India have the latest technology and infrastructure to offer the most advanced spine surgery at low cost.</p>

                        <h4>Disc NucleoplastySurgery</h4>
                        <p>Nucleoplasty is a minimally invasive procedure designed to treat back pain or leg pain caused by contained disc herniations. It works by decompressing the nucleus of the disc. Similar to letting air out of a tire, removing tissue from the center of a disc causes a reduction of pressure within the disc. This in turn leads to a reduction in the pressure that the disc applies to other parts of the body, such as nerve roots or the spinal cord.</p>
                        <p>During the procedure, an instrument is introduced through a needle and placed into the center of the disc where a series of channels are created to remove tissue from the nucleus. As pressure is relieved, pain is reduced, consistent with the clinical results of earlier percutaneous discectomy procedures. There is little tissue trauma and recovery times may be improved in many patients. A herniated disc may occur suddenly in an event such as a fall or an accident, or may occur gradually with repetitive straining of the spine.</p>

                        <h4>How does the Disc Nucleoplasty procedure work?</h4>
                        <p>Nucleoplasty requires the patient to lie on his/her stomach for the lumbar procedure or back for the cervical procedure. The procedure is performed under X-ray guidance to accurately place a needle into the disc. Sedation may be administered by your doctor. A small nick is made in the skin near the spine, and a needle is inserted. The decompression device, called a SpineWand, is then inserted through the needle into the disc and activated to remove tissue. The device and the needle are removed and the small nick is covered with a bandage.</p>
