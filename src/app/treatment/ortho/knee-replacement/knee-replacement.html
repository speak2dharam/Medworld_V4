                        <h4>Knee Replacement Surgeries and Technique at World's Best Hospitals in India</h4>
                        <p>Your knee joint is made up by the lower end of your thigh bone (femur) and the upper end of your shin bone (tibia). These normally glide over each other easily because they are covered by smooth cartilage. If your cartilage is damaged by injury or worn away by arthritis, it can make your joint painful and stiff . A new knee joint will usually improve your mobility and reduce pain, although your new knee won’t be able to bend quite as far as a normal knee joint.</p>
                        <p>Depending on the condition of your knee joint, you may need to have part, or all, of your knee joint replaced. If you have arthritis just in one area of your knee joint, usually the inside part of the joint called the medial compartment, you may be offered a partial knee replacement (called a unicondylar knee replacement). However, a total knee replacement is more common. Artificial knee parts are almost always made of metal (on the femur side) and plastic (on the tibia side) and a knee replacement can last for up to 20 years.</p>
                        <h4>Types of Knee Replacement Surgery</h4>
                        <p>There are two main types of surgery, depending on the condition of the knee</p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>Total Knee Replacement (TKR) – both sides of your knee joint are replaced</li>
                            <li>Partial (half) Knee Replacement (PKR) – only one side of your joint is replaced in a smaller operation with a shorter hospital stay and recovery period</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Knee surgery is recommended for older people, although adults or teenagers of any age can be candidates for the procedure, since they are physically active and will more rapidly wear the joint out. The weight, gender, or age of the person is never a factor when considering knee replacement surgery. When considering the option of knee replacement surgery, doctors take into account a number of symptoms:</p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>Severe knee pain or stiffness: Do symptoms seriously undermine the patient's ability to carry out everyday tasks and activities, such as walking, going upstairs, getting in and out of cars, getting up from a chair, etc?</li>
                            <li>Moderate but continuous knee pain: Is pain present while sleeping or resting?</li>
                            <li>Chronic knee inflammation and swelling: Does the swelling not improve after taking medications or resting? Do drugs cause unpleasant side effects?</li>
                            <li>Knee deformity: Is there is a noticeable arch in the inside or outside of the knee?</li>
                            <li>Nothing else worked: The doctor has prescribed medications and physical therapy without any substantial improvement.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <hr>
                        <h4>Knee Replacement Surgeries and Techniques Available at MedWorld India</h4>
                        <h6>Total Knee Replacement </h6>
                        <p>Also called total knee arthroplasty, this surgery is for people who have extensive damage in several parts of their knee. The surgeon removes the diseased cartilage, as well as some of the underlying bone, and then fuses an artificial joint to the bone that remains.</p>
                        <h6>Partial Knee Replacement</h6>
                        <p>If the cartilage in just one of the knee's sections becomes damaged, Mayo Clinic surgeons can sometimes replace just the damaged section instead of the whole knee joint. Recovery is easier than with total knee replacement, but the results may not last as long, because arthritis could develop in other areas of the knee.</p>
                        <h6>Minimally Invasive Surgery</h6>
                        <p>Minimally invasive techniques allow surgeons to replace a knee using smaller incisions. This usually results in less pain and a quicker recovery. But minimally invasive knee replacement requires special surgical training, and it may not work for everyone. Your orthopedic surgeon will determine whether you're a good candidate for the minimally invasive approach.</p>
                        <h6>Bilateral Knee Replacement </h6>
                        <p>Having both knees replaced at once can reduce the overall time spent in rehabilitation following surgery, but it's not recommended for some people, such as those with heart or lung disease.</p>
