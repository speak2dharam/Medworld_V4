                        <h4>Meniscus Tear Surgery</h4>
                        <p>A meniscus tear is usually caused by twisting or turning quickly, often with the footplanted while the knee is bent. These tears can occur when you lift something heavy or play sports. As you get older, your meniscus gets worn. This can make it tear more easily.</p>
                        <p>A meniscus tear is a common knee injury. The meniscus is a rubbery, C-shaped disc that cushions your knee. Each knee has two menisci (plural of meniscus)-one at the outer edge of the knee and one at the inner edge. The menisci keep your knee steady by balancing your weight across the knee. A torn meniscus can prevent your knee from working right.</p>
                        <h6>Ankle replacement replaces the damaged parts of the three bones that make up the ankle joint. Artificial joint parts (prosthetics) are used to replace your own bones. They come in different sizes to fit different-size people.</h6>
                        <h5>Symptoms of Meniscus Tear</h5>
                        <p>The Symptoms of a torn meniscus will vary depending on the severity of the tear. Someone who gets a minor tear may only have slight pain and swelling that goes away after 2 or 3 weeks. Moderate to severe tears also might cause these symptoms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A "pop" in the knee when the tear occurs.</li>
                            <li>Pain in the center or side of the knee, especially when twisting the knee or squatting.</li>
                            <li>Limited Range of Motion.</li>
                            <li>The feeling as if the knee is locking or popping when bending; it might not straighten.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <hr>
                        <h4>Meniscus Repair Surgery at World's Best Hospitals in India</h4>
                        <p>If your meniscus is severely damaged or has been removed, it is likely that the articular cartilage protecting your knee will begin to wear. As this cartilage wears away, it becomes frayed and rough. Moving the bones along this exposed surface is painful. This condition is osteoarthritis. The goal of meniscal transplant surgery is to replace the meniscus cushion before the articular cartilage is damaged. The donor cartilage supports and stabilizes the knee joint. This relieves knee pain. The hope is that the transplant will also delay the development of arthritis, but long-term results are not yet available.</p>
                        <p>Suffering the pain, joint inflammation and immobility caused by a torn or injured meniscus may benefit from meniscus repair procedures. While most tears are the result of sports injuries, the aging process may also cause degeneration and wear and tear on the cartilage. In cases of the elderly, a surgeon will determine which type of treatment will provide greater range of motion, mobility and pain relief.</p>
