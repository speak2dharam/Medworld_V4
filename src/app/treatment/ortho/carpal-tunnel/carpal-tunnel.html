                        <h4>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</h4>
                        <p>The carpal tunnel is a narrow, tunnel-like structure in the wrist. The bottom and sides of this tunnel are formed by wrist (carpal) bones. The top of the tunnel is covered by a strong band of connective tissue called the transverse carpal ligament. The median nerve travels from the forearm into the hand through this tunnel in the wrist. The median nerve controls feeling in the palm side of the thumb, index finger, and long fingers. The nerve also controls the muscles around the base of the thumb. The tendons that bend the fingers and thumb also travel through the carpal tunnel. These tendons are called flexor tendons.</p>
                        <p>It is the most common nerve entrapment syndrome, characterized by paresthesias, typically nocturnal, and sometimes sensory loss and wasting in the median nerve distribution in the hand; often bilateral and affects women more than men; due to chronic entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist within the carpal tunnel.</p>
                        <h6>Symptons </h6>
                        <p>The Most Common Symptons of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Include</p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>Numbness, tingling, and pain in the hand</li>
                            <li>An electric shock-like feeling mostly in the thumb, index, and long fingers</li>
                            <li>Strange sensations and pain traveling up the arm toward the shoulder</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Symptoms usually begin gradually, without a specific injury. In most people, symptoms are more severe on the thumb side of the hand.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h4>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</h4>
                        <p>When these initial efforts fail to control symptoms, an operation called a carpal tunnel release is advised by your surgeon. During the procedure, the surgeon carefully cuts the wrist ligament, releasing the pressure inside the carpal tunnel, usually providing almost instantaneous relief from arm and hand pain and tingling. As the wound heals, new tissue will bridge the severed ligament in about six weeks, making the ligament long enough to create additional space inside the tunnel and prevent recurrence of symptoms in most cases.</p>
                        <p>The most common surgery for relieving carpal tunnel symptoms involves cutting the transverse carpal ligament to relieve pressure on the median nerve in the wrist. Two approaches for this surgery are :</p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li><strong>Open carpal tunnel release surgery</strong>, which allows the doctor to see more of the inner tissues, including the full width of the transverse carpal ligament where it is to be cut. Open surgery requires an incision in the palm and wrist, which disturbs more of the tissues in the hand, and requires a longer recovery period. It leaves a larger scar than does endoscopic surgery. But there may be less chance of other complications. See a picture of open carpal tunnel surgery.</li>
                            <li><strong>Endoscopic carpal tunnel release surgery</strong>, which requires only a small incision at the wrist (single-portal technique) or at the wrist and palm (two-portal technique), and which disturbs less tissue in the hand. Recovery is quicker than with open surgery. And the scars heal more quickly, are smaller, and tend to be less painful at 3 months after surgery. There may be a slightly higher rate of reoperation after endoscopic carpal tunnel surgery. See a picture of endoscopic carpal tunnel surgery.</li>
