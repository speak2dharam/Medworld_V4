                        <h4>Elbow Joint Replacement Surgery at World's Best Hospitals in India</h4>
                        <p>Any type of surgery performed on a bone or joint is considered a type of orthopedic surgery. Injuries to the elbow are common in athletes, such as those who play contact sports, as well as tennis, golf, and baseball or football, but are also caused by falls or accidents. Several types of elbow surgery are available for treatment, depending on the damage done to bone, muscular tissues or tendons and ligaments.</p>
                        <p>Elbow joint replacement, also known as Total elbow arthroplasty or Endoprosthetic elbow replacement, is the surgery to replace the worn out bones of the elbow joint with man- made joints of metal or plastic. Elbow replacement surgery is quite successful; the success rate is more than 90%. The procedure is thus becoming quite popular among patients and surgeons in aging adults to replace suffering from arthritis and fracture.</p>
                        <h6>When is Elbow Replacement Surgery needed?</h6>
                        <p>When the elbow joint gets damaged to such an extent that you are unable to move your arm, Elbow Joint Replacement Surgery is recommended. The major cause of elbow joint damage includes:</p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>Osteoarthritis</li>
                            <li>Bad results from previous elbow surgery</li>
                            <li>Rheumatoid arthritis</li>
                            <li>Post-traumatic arthritis</li>
                            <li>Badly broken bone in the upper or lower arm near the elbow</li>
                            <li>Badly damaged tissues in the elbow</li>

                        </ul>
                        <hr>
                        <h4>Various Types of Elbow Surgeries</h4>
                        <p><strong>Tennis Elbow Surgery</strong> - Tennis elbow surgery consists of making an incision over the outside of the joint, and locating the area of the tendon that has suffered damage. Tennis Elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is the most common treatment available for patients seeking surgical treatment for elbow joint pain. It is caused due to small tears of the ligaments that attach forearm muscles to the arm bone in the elbow joint.</p>
                        <p><strong>Elbow Arthritis Surgery</strong> - Also known as Elbow debridement, Elbow Arthritis Surgery is a type of surgery wherein arthritis causes significant loss of movement. During the surgery, a 10 centimeter incision is made on the back of the elbow. Thereafter, all the loose bodies and bone spurs that are hindering elbow movement are removed. A fenestration is then made at the end of the arm bone</p>
                        <p><strong>Arthroscopic Elbow Surgery - It is used to diagnose and treat conditions inside the joint.</strong></p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li><strong>Open carpal tunnel release surgery</strong>, which allows the doctor to see more of the inner tissues, including the full width of the transverse carpal ligament where it is to be cut. Open surgery requires an incision in the palm and wrist, which disturbs more of the tissues in the hand, and requires a longer recovery period. It leaves a larger scar than does endoscopic surgery. But there may be less chance of other complications. See a picture of open carpal tunnel surgery.</li>
                            <li><strong>Endoscopic carpal tunnel release surgery</strong>, which requires only a small incision at the wrist (single-portal technique) or at the wrist and palm (two-portal technique), and which disturbs less tissue in the hand. Recovery is quicker than with open surgery. And the scars heal more quickly, are smaller, and tend to be less painful at 3 months after surgery. There may be a slightly higher rate of reoperation after endoscopic carpal tunnel surgery. See a picture of endoscopic carpal tunnel surgery.</li>
