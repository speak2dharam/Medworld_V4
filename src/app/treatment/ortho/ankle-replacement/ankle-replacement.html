                        <h4>Ankle Replacement Surgery</h4>
                        <p>Ankle replacement surgery is performed to replace the damaged articular surfaces of the three bones of the ankle joint with artificial implants. This procedure is now being preferred to arthrodesis (fusion of the bones) because ankle replacement surgery restores range of motion to the joint. The surgery is normally offered to patients with arthritis who do not suffer from osteoporosis of the ankle.</p>
                        <p>Total ankle replacement surgery, also known as Total ankle arthroplasty or Endoprosthetic ankle replacement is a procedure performed for patients with advanced ankle osteoarthritis. The aim of an ankle replacement is to eradicate persistent pain and preserve ankle mobility.</p>
                        <p>Ankle replacement replaces the damaged parts of the three bones that make up the ankle joint. Artificial joint parts (prosthetics) are used to replace your own bones. They come in different sizes to fit different-size people.</p>
                        <h5>Who should consider undergoing Ankle Replacement?</h5>
                        <p>Ankle replacement surgery is done if the ankle joint is severely damaged. Your symptoms may be pain and loss of movement of the ankle. Some causes of damage are:</p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>Arthritis caused by ankle surgery in the past</li>
                            <li>Bone fracture</li>
                            <li>Infection</li>
                            <li>Osteoarthritis</li>
                            <li>Rheumatoid arthritis</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>How does the ankle replacement surgery work?</h5>
                        <p>Ankle replacement involves replacing the natural surfaces of the ankle joint which have degenerated with an artificial cover known as prosthesis. The ankle replacement has three components. Two of the components cover the joint and in the middle there is a third, mobile component. This allows for greater movement and reduces the stress between the bone and the implants.</p>
                        <p>The component which covers the part of the ankle joint known as the tibia is flat. It is integrated into the bone with a short stem. The component which covers the part of the ankle joint known as the talus is curved and fixed into place with pegs. All the components are covered in a bioactive coating which encourages the patient's own bone to grow into the artificial fixtures.</p>
