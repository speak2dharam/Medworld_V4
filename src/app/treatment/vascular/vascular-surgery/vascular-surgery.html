                        <p>Most Advanced Vascular Surgery in India Vascular surgery Vascular Surgery is a particular kind of surgery that deals with surgical interventions of arteries and veins. Also cures for disease of the vascular system. It deals with treatment of the areas of dilatation of the blood vessel that can rupture if not treated. Blockages of blood vessels treated by vascular surgeons if not treated causes lack of blood flow to the body, stroke and other serious complications. The treatment requires removal of the area of blockage, carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting in which a tube is placed within the artery that allows blood flow.</p>
                        <p>Vascular surgery is also often used to treat abdominal aneurysms or help prevent strokes. If found in advance, a vascular specialist may surgically treat blocked arteries in the neck or upper chest to help prevent a possible stroke. A vascular surgeon may also surgically address vascular trauma or surgically redirect blood vessels in patients with poor circulation due to conditions such as diabetes and peripheral vascular disease.</p>
                        <p>Patients with problems of the lymphatic system, such as lymphedema, may also require the care of a vascular surgical physician. Lymphedema is the retention of the fluids that carry blood products from the vessels to the cells. A vascular surgeon may also consult with patients suffering from scleroderma, an autoimmune disease that causes hardening of tissues, or Raynaud's syndrome, a disorder of the extremities that is characterized by blood vessel spasms and decreased blood flow.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Different Types of Vascular Surgery Procedures</h4>
                        <p>Vascular surgery treats diseases of the arteries and veins. Most vascular surgeries are minimally invasive and address a number of vascular conditions and diseases. Here are some different types of vascular surgery.</p>
                        <h5>Carotid Stenting</h5>
                        <p>Carotid stenting is a procedure used to widen the artery in an effort to prevent stroke. The surgeon inserts a slender metal mesh tube into the carotid artery to increase blood flow to areas previously blocked by plaque. After the surgery, your physician may instruct you not to do any heavy lifting. Another common instruction is to take blood thinners following the surgery.</p>

                        <h5>Vein Stripping</h5>
                        <p>Vein stripping is used to treat varicose veins. Not only are varicose veins unsightly, but they are also painful in many cases. Vein stripping is a procedure done under anesthesia to remove varicose veins. Vein stripping is considered minor surgery. An incision is made below the vein. A thin wire is then inserted and used to grasp and remove the damaged vein. This is usually done as an outpatient procedure. In some cases, patients are asked to stay overnight. Patients are instructed to avoid physical activity for several weeks following the surgery.</p>
                        <h5>Endovascular Aneurysm Repair</h5>
                        <p>Endovascular aneurysm repair is a procedure used to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms. An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a ballooning of the abdominal aorta. It usually occurs below the kidneys. This condition is most common in men and smokers aged 65 to 75. When the aneurysm is large enough, surgery is recommended. Endovasular aneurysm repair involves inserting a small graft inside of the aneurysm. The placement of the graft allows blood to pass through and removes pressure off the weakening aortic wall. Endovascular patients have an average hospital stay of eight days.</p>
                        <h5>Balloon Embolectomy Thrombectomy</h5>
                        <p>Acute limb ischaemia occurs when there is a sudden loss of blood flow to the limb. A balloon embolectomy thrombectomy is used to treat this condition. It is considered a minimally invasive surgery. It consists of a hollow tube with a small balloon at the tip. The tube is placed through an incision through the blood vessel. The balloon is inflated so that it displaces the blood clot that is interrupting blood flow to the limb. Expect bruising or swelling around the area post-surgery. The typical hospital stay is five to seven days.</p>
