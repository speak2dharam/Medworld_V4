                    <h4>What is Kidney Transplantation?</h4>
                    <p><strong>Kidney transplantation</strong> is a surgical procedure in which a healthy kidney from a
                        donor is placed into a person whose kidneys no longer function properly. It is considered one of
                        the most effective treatments for <strong>end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)</strong> or
                        <strong>chronic kidney failure</strong>, when the kidneys have lost about 90% of their ability
                        to function.

                    <h4>Why is a Kidney Transplant Needed?</h4>
                    <p>The kidneys are vital organs responsible for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Filtering waste products and excess fluids from the blood</li>
                        <li>Regulating blood pressure</li>
                        <li>Balancing electrolytes</li>
                        <li>Producing certain hormones that help regulate blood production and bone health</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When the kidneys fail, these essential functions are impaired. People with kidney failure often
                        need <strong>dialysis</strong> or a <strong>kidney transplant</strong> to survive.
                        Transplantation is often preferred over lifelong dialysis because it improves quality of life
                        and survival rates.</p>

                    <h4>Types of Kidney Transplants</h4>
                    <p>There are two main types of kidney donors:</p>

                    <h5>1. Living Donor Transplant</h5>
                    <p>A healthy person (usually a family member, friend, or altruistic donor) donates one of their
                        kidneys. Since a person can live with one functioning kidney, this is a common option. Living
                        donor transplants usually have better outcomes because:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The kidney is removed and transplanted quickly</li>
                        <li>Surgery can be planned in advance</li>
                        <li>The donor is carefully evaluated for compatibility</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>2. Deceased Donor Transplant</h5>
                    <p>In this case, the kidney is taken from a person who has recently died and whose family has
                        consented to organ donation. These kidneys are matched with recipients on a waiting list, based
                        on factors like blood type, tissue compatibility, and urgency.</p>

                    <h4>The Kidney Transplant Procedure</h4>

                    <h5>Pre-Transplant Evaluation</h5>
                    <p>Before the transplant, the recipient undergoes a series of tests including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Blood tests</li>
                        <li>Imaging studies</li>
                        <li>Psychological evaluations</li>
                        <li>Compatibility tests (blood type and HLA matching)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>The Surgery</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The donor kidney is placed in the lower abdomen.</li>
                        <li>The recipient’s original kidneys are usually not removed unless there’s a medical reason.
                        </li>
                        <li>Blood vessels from the donor kidney are connected to the recipient’s blood vessels.</li>
                        <li>The ureter (tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) is connected to the
                            bladder.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The surgery usually lasts 3–5 hours and is performed under general anesthesia.</p>

                    <h4>After the Transplant</h4>
                    <p>After surgery, the recipient will:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stay in the hospital for monitoring (typically 5–10 days)</li>
                        <li>Take <strong>immunosuppressive medications</strong> to prevent the body from rejecting the
                            new kidney</li>
                        <li>Attend regular follow-up appointments for blood tests and health checks</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Risks and Complications</h4>
                    <p>While kidney transplantation is generally safe, there are some risks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Rejection</strong>: The immune system may see the new kidney as a threat</li>
                        <li><strong>Infections</strong>: Due to immunosuppressants</li>
                        <li><strong>Surgical complications</strong>: Bleeding, blood clots, or leakage from the ureter
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Organ failure</strong>: The transplanted kidney might not work as expected</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Benefits of Kidney Transplantation</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improved quality of life</li>
                        <li>Freedom from dialysis</li>
                        <li>More energy and better appetite</li>
                        <li>Longer life expectancy compared to patients on long-term dialysis</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>Kidney transplantation is a life-saving treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease.
                        With proper medical care, a transplanted kidney can function well for many years. Advances in
                        surgical techniques and medications have made kidney transplants more successful than ever
                        before. For eligible patients, it offers the best chance for a healthier, more normal life.</p>
