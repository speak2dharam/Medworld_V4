                        <h4>What is a Liver Transplant?</h4>
                        <p>
                            A <strong>liver transplant</strong> is a surgical procedure that involves replacing a
                            diseased or damaged liver with a healthy liver from a donor. The donor liver can come from a
                            deceased donor or a living donor who donates a portion of their liver.

                        <h4>Why is a Liver Transplant Needed?</h4>
                        <p>Liver transplants are usually recommended when the liver is severely damaged and no longer
                            able to function properly. Common reasons include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cirrhosis</strong> (scarring of the liver due to chronic liver diseases such as
                                hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or alcoholism)</li>
                            <li><strong>Liver cancer</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Acute liver failure</strong> (sudden and severe liver damage)</li>
                            <li><strong>Genetic liver diseases</strong> (such as Wilson’s disease or hemochromatosis)
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Biliary atresia</strong> (a condition mostly seen in infants where bile ducts
                                are blocked)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>

                        <h4>Types of Liver Transplants</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Deceased Donor Liver Transplant</strong><br />
                                The entire liver or a portion is transplanted from a person who has recently passed away
                                and whose organs are donated.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Living Donor Liver Transplant</strong><br />
                                A portion of a healthy person's liver (usually a close relative or friend) is
                                transplanted. The liver regenerates in both donor and recipient over time.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>The Liver Transplant Procedure</h4>

                        <h5>Pre-Transplant Evaluation</h5>
                        <p>
                            Patients undergo thorough medical tests to assess liver function, overall health, and
                            suitability for surgery. This includes blood tests, imaging, heart and lung function tests,
                            and psychological evaluation.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Finding a Donor</h5>
                        <p>
                            The patient is placed on a transplant waiting list based on the severity of liver disease
                            (using a scoring system called MELD or PELD).
                        </p>

                        <h5>Surgery</h5>
                        <p>The liver transplant surgery usually lasts 6 to 12 hours:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The diseased liver is removed.</li>
                            <li>The donor liver or liver segment is placed in the body.</li>
                            <li>Blood vessels and bile ducts are connected.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Risks and Complications</h4>
                        <p>Like all major surgeries, liver transplants carry some risks:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Rejection:</strong> The immune system may attack the new liver.
                                Immunosuppressant drugs are used to prevent this.</li>
                            <li><strong>Infections:</strong> Due to immune suppression after transplant.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bleeding or blood clots</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Bile duct complications</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Side effects of medications</strong></li>

                            <li><strong>Follow-ups:</strong> Regular check-ups, blood tests, and imaging.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, exercise, and avoiding

                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>
                            A liver transplant is a complex but life-saving procedure for people with severe liver
                            disease. Advances in surgical techniques and immunosuppressive therapy have significantly
                            improved outcomes. If you or a loved one is facing liver failure, consulting with a
                            transplant specialist is crucial to explore this option.
