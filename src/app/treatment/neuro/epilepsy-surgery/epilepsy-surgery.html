                        <h5>What is Epilepsy ?</h5>
                        <p>A disorder of the brain that also includes recurring seizures is termed as epilepsy. These seizures are due to chemical and electrical activity of the brain. Seizures can happen anywhere in the brain and involves multiple causes. A person has seizures when –</p>
                        <p>Doctors in these specialties may also diagnose and treat conditions of the spinal cord using similar techniques, although not through a blood vessel. These types of procedures are called “minimally invasive” because they generally require only a tiny incision instead of a larger incision necessary for open surgery.</p>
                        <p><strong>Endovascular neurosurgery treats a variety of vascular diseases such as:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The causes of the seizures can be prevented.</li>
                            <li>There are 2 or more seizures.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Types of Epilepsy</h5>

                        </ul>
                        <h5>Why is Epilepsy surgery required?</h5>
                        <p>Epilepsy surgery has proven to be successful in reducing and even eliminating seizures in patients who did not respond well to the epilepsy medications. It is important to get the treatment for epilepsy, repeated seizures may result in:</p>
                        <p>After 2–4 weeks, there is a follow-up to remove sutures, turn on the neurostimulator and program it.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Irreparable Brain damage from repeated seizures</li>
                            <li>Sudden death, a rare complication</li>
                            <li>Injuries from falling / driving during various activities</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Advanced Epilepsy Treatment Options Available at World's Best Hospital in India</h4>
                        <p>Till the time a person develops a second seizure, treatment for epilepsy will not begin. This is due to the reason that a person may have one seizure and never develops a second seizure. Medicines are successful in treating epilepsy. These medicines do not cure epilepsy, they prevent recurring of the seizures. These medicines changes the chemical or electrical transmissions in the brain in a particle way that decreases the chance of a seizure.</p>
                        <h5>Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) :</h5>
                        <p>VNS therapy is recommended when medicines are unable to control epilepsy. During the surgical procedure, an electrical device is implanted underneath the skin. The lead of this device is wrapped around one of the nerves on the neck’s left side. This nerve is called as vagus nerve. This device continuously passes an electric dose to the nerve in order to stimulate it. This process reduces the severity and frequency of the seizures. If a person is feeling a warning seizure symptom then extra stimulation is given for preventing recurrence of the seizure.</p>
                        <p>Ketogenic Diet : This is also considered as one of the treatment for epilepsy. Ketogenic diet is recommended for children as it involves eating a diet which is low in proteins and carbohydrates and high in fats. The chemical balance of the brain can be altered that also reduces the chance of having seizures. Ketogenic diet is not meant for adults as the diet can result in any other serious medical condition like heart disease, high blood pressure or strokes.</p>
                        <h5>Advanced Surgical Procedures for Management of Epilepsy</h5>
                        <p>Depending on the particular clinical situation, one of the following surgical procedures is chosen by the Medical team at our affiliate hospital. These operations either aim to resect the disease area of the brain, to disconnect it from other areas so as to relieve the seizures, or to lessen their impact.</p>
