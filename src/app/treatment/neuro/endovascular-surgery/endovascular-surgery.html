                        <p>Epilepsy surgery in India is a very good option for abroad patients seeking low cost and safe surgical treatment for the correction of their disorders. Medical tourism in India provides very good assistance to international patients for their comfortable treatment in India. Significant option for curing epileptics. For neurosurgery, patients must find surgeons who are appropriately trained. Another factor to consider is cost and reimbursement. Typical cost for epilepsy surgery can vary, and many insurance companies will only provide partial coverage, or even no coverage, since they still consider the surgery experimental. And finally, patients need to be aware that like any new medical technology, this surgery carries with it a certain level of unknown technical risks. Since epilepsy surgery it is still a relatively new procedure in India with a certain level of risks. The cost of Epilepsy surgery in India is very less compared to that of its cost in other developed countries. Most advanced surgery hospitals for Epilepsy surgery in India are in most prominent cities of India.</p>

                        <h4>Endovascular Neurosurgery at World's Best Hospital in India</h4>
                        <p>Neurosurgery is a branch of surgery that treats conditions and diseases of the brain and nervous system. Radiology is a medical specialty that helps diagnose and treat conditions and diseases using various radiology techniques. Endovascular neurosurgery is a subspecialty within neurosurgery that uses catheters and radiology to diagnose and treat various conditions and diseases of the central nervous system. The central nervous system is made up of the brain and the spinal cord. This medical specialty is also called Neurointerventional Surgery.</p>
                        <p>Interventional neuroradiology is a subspecialty within radiology that also involves catheters and radiology to diagnose and treat neurological conditions and diseases. The term endovascular means “inside a blood vessel.” Endovascular neurosurgery uses tools that pass through the blood vessels to diagnose and treat diseases and conditions rather than using open surgery. The surgeon often uses radiology images to help him or her to see the part of the body involved in the procedure.</p>
                        <p>Doctors in these specialties may also diagnose and treat conditions of the spinal cord using similar techniques, although not through a blood vessel. These types of procedures are called “minimally invasive” because they generally require only a tiny incision instead of a larger incision necessary for open surgery.</p>
                        <p><strong>Endovascular neurosurgery treats a variety of vascular diseases such as:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="TOptn">
                            <li>Stroke</li>
                            <li>Aneurysms</li>
                            <li>Arterio-venous malformations</li>
                            <li>IArterial stenosis</li>
                            <li>Dural arterio-venous fistulas</li>
                            <li>Vascular Tumours</li>
                            <li>Carotid Cavernous sinus fistulae</li>
                            <li>Cerebral revascularization after clotting</li>
                            <li>Vasospastic arteries</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Neuro specialists in India use computer-assisted brain surgery, intraoperative MRI and awake brain surgery during deep brain stimulation.</p>
                        <p>Indian Neurologists are ranked among the Best surgeons for neurology and neurosurgery worldwide. Because the brain can shift slightly during surgery, there is the possibility that the electrodes can become displaced or dislodged. This may cause more profound complications such as personality changes, but electrode misplacement is relatively easy to identify using CT.</p>
                        <p>After 2–4 weeks, there is a follow-up to remove sutures, turn on the neurostimulator and program it.</p>
                        <h5>Endovascular Neurosurgical procedures in India :</h5>
                        <p>Thrombolytic therapy. This procedure uses “clot-busting” medication to dissolve a clot in a blood vessel in the brain or elsewhere in the body.</p>
                        <p>Endovascular coiling. A surgeon inserts a very thin metal wire that forms a coil inside a brain aneurysm to block blood flow. A brain aneurysm is a bulging, weakened area in the wall of an artery in the brain, resulting in an abnormal widening or ballooning. Because the artery wall has a weakened spot, the aneurysm is at risk for bursting if blood flow isn’t blocked.</p>
                        <p>Minimally invasive spine surgery. This procedure is used to treat spinal disorders such as fractures, tumors, compressed nerves, and other conditions that put pressure on the spinal cord.</p>
                        <p>Cerebral angiography. This is a radiology procedure that looks at how well blood is flowing in the brain.</p>
                        <p>Carotid artery angioplasty/stenting. This procedure uses a small balloon and/or a tiny metal scaffold called a stent to open a narrowed carotid artery. The carotid arteries supply blood to the brain.</p>
