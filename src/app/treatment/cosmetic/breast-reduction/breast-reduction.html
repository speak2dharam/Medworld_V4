                        <p>Breast reduction surgery also called reduction mammoplasty, is a medical procedure that is used to remove excess fat and tissues from the breast area to reduce the overall size of a personâ€™s breast.</p>
                        <p>Women having large breasts that are out of proportion to the rest of their body and causing neck pain, back pain, or other symptoms may consider having breast reduction surgery.</p>
                        <p>The procedure is a twofer. The surgeon will remove excess tissue and skin to make the breasts smaller, and then move the nipples up in a position to give them a lift.</p>
                        <p>Men with conditions such as gynecomastia (in which male breasts are abnormally enlarged) may also consider having the surgery.</p>

                        <h5>Who can and cannot have Breast Reduction Surgery?</h5>
                        <p>Breast reduction is an outpatient procedure with minimal risks. Some rare complications include infection, scarring, and loss of sensation in the nipples or breasts. It has one of the highest satisfaction rates of all plastic surgery procedures.</p>
                        <p>Any person with good physical and medical health can get the surgery done. While consulting, your surgeon will ask about your habits, including whether you smoke and what medications you take. You will have to quit smoking for a period before and after surgery to ensure proper healing. You may have to stop taking certain medications like anti-inflammatory drugs. The surgeon will also want to know if you have had any lump removed before and your family medical history.</p>
